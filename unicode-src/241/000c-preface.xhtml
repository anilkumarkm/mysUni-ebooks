<p>This is the third compilation in the series of Convocation Addresses of the University of Mysore. Strictly speaking, Shri C. Hayavadana Rao compiled the first volume in 1930; thus providing a platform for all the Convocation Addresses made until then from the beginning. The second compilation was made available by Prof. M. Madaiah, the then Vice-Chancellor, as Chief Editor and Prof. Anantharamaiah and Dr. K.S. Shivanna as Editors in 1993. This volume, treated as the first volume, includes all the speeches from 1916 to 1993. Our concern was to collect the Convocation Addresses from 1994 to 1914 which we have done with a view to obtaining a perspective that will enable us to gain confidence as we move along in this difficult terrain of higher education which is fraught with newer and newer challenges even as it proffers ever-new opportunities undreamt of by our predecessors.</p>
<p>It is highly regrettable that the full text of Prof. C.N.R. Rao's speech is not made available as he spoke impromptu. We have done the next best thing: a small note based on newspaper reports is given. We are aware that it is not a substitute for the original speech.</p>
<p>I have been a part of this hallowed University for more than three decades and therefore I have seen its growth and evolution from close quarters: generations of students, a large body of teachers and an army of administrative staff, have contributed in their own way for the blossoming of this University, which is rightfully described as the “alma-mater’of the majority of universities in the State of Karnataka.</p>
<p>The distinguished dignitaries who have delivered the Convocation Speeches have invariably taken note of the hoary past and the accomplishments of our University. The very ambience as well as the rich history of our University has inspired those speakers and has lifted their oratorical skills to a new height as it is evident in the text that follows.</p>
<p>They have underlined the need to achieve global standards in higher education both in terms of quality and quantity (Shri Arjun Singh). They have emphasized how nations advance along the course charted by great dreamers (Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam). The ethos built around our civilization and culture has, unquestionably, been a composite identity and has depicted unique homogeneity (Justice A.M.Ahmadi). In the realm of ideas, India has always been a leader and it is confident of setting the mood and tone for others to follow (Prof. R.A. Mashelkar).</p>
<p>The luminaries who have delivered these speeches have visualized education as an organic entity and a dynamic process. Therefore it ought to have a holistic vision to devote sufficient attention to the real benefactor of our society, namely, the common man, whose sacrifice could be compensated by our adequate indebtedness.</p>
<p>They have all drawn our attention invariably to the contemporary realities where there is an erosion of ethical and moral standards and hence there is an urgent need to stem this erosion and to inculcate work culture in research and teaching. Higher education, according to some, is an opportunity to attract and integrate intelligence of any nationality seamlessly so that the concept of 'internationality' is upheld and the graduates are enabled to attain capability and competence. The experts have said that the path to our tryst with destiny is strewn with thorns and obstacles which the civil society and state must remove ceaselessly and ruthlessly with a renewed civic and political will.</p>
<p>Almost all luminaries have underscored the supremacy of character over mere academic attainments. They have remembered the everlasting words of Swami Vivekananada, Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Walt Whitman, Patanjali, and so on. The very fact that the words of the spiritual masters are invoked indicates that the past forms a necessary bedrock on which we can build a strong present so that the future generation will have a shelter of luminous ideas to guard them and to guide them unfailingly.</p>
<p>Wisdom is the destination that beckons all wayfarers who march on without stopping at the sign-posts of information and knowledge, though it is alluring to linger at these primary and secondary halts. The individual ought to halt-and-proceed towards the summit of wisdom. They expect education to dispel the darkness and gloom that surrounds us during our earthly journey. Every human being must act as a candle to minimize the ghastly absence of light.</p>
<p>True knowledge, according to one of the speakers, enables a person to be genuine in his dealings so that people are instinctively drawn towards him as they find him dependable and trustworthy. Some have accepted the Buddha as the guiding star as he said with unalloyed confidence: “You are your own beacon lights”. Therefore, there is nothing worthwhile than keeping an alert mind ever-oriented in the direction of knowledge. This orientation would surely make us realize that there is a large segment of our society which is incapacitated since ages because of social disparity and discrimination. Therefore there is an urgent need to address the issue of inclusiveness which involves affordability. “Without affordability, it is not possible to increase access and promote inclusiveness. Thus, affordability will have to be ensured through special measures" (Prof. Sukhdeo Thorat).</p>
<p>What is the good of attaining knowledge then? The answer is : "Every individual is duty-bound to acquire knowledge, to give it back to the society by making useful addition to it and to use it for securing happiness to fellow human beings” (Justice Dr. M. Rama Jois).</p>
<p>The experts reassure us that we are not under any compulsion to continue the colonial legacy in the field of education because we have to reshape the same to suit the needs of the society of the future. There are twin objectives that stare us in the face: that is, to become the global economic power and also the global ethical power. Achieving the latter is, perhaps, more important than achieving the former. If we could achieve both simultaneously we would have done justice to the expectations of our forefathers who never swerved from the path of righteousness and integrity.</p>
<p>The experts have alerted us to guard against giving lopsided emphasis on one aspect of life at the cost of the other. “We must realize that the entire education system, intellect and intuition, science and spirituality, living and learning have to be promoted in a balanced manner. Character is the foundation upon which rises the spiritual edifice. As long as one is a slave of the senses, talk of spirituality is a mockery” (Dr. D. Purandeswari). The culture of care - they warn us - compassion, catholicity and commitment is necessary to cancel the current culture of casualness and conceit.</p>
<p>As one can see, this compilation of Convocation Addresses, is a veritable goldmine of ideas very essential for present practice and future guidance. I would like to conclude this brief Foreword by invoking the words of two stalwarts who have given us a clear-cut definition of the role of a University and what it ought to represent (Jawaharlal Nehru) and the significance of Convocations (Dr. Hari Gautam):</p>
<p>(1) “A University stands for humanism, for tolerance, for reason, for progress, for the adventure of ideas, and for the search for truth. It stands for the onward race towards even the higher objectives. If the universities discharge their duties properly then it is well with the nation" (Jawaharlal Nehru in his Convocation Address at Allahabad University).</p>
<p>Convocations are important in the life of a University and its graduates. The Convocations give us a sense of identity, continuity across years and reaffirm the duty of each generation transmit best of its knowledge, wisdom and culture to the next ones. Besides, it provides an opportunity to all graduates to ceremonially receive their degrees and · merit credentials” (Dr. Hari Gautam).</p>
<p>History is nothing but trajectory of the march of ideas. It is the ideas that have moulded the human society from its infancy onwards. We can infer that this world is not very young as the scientists claim they have recently discovered the skeleton of dinosaurs which is 135 million years old. That means, we have traversed quite a long distance. But the path ahead also seems to be interminable though there are attempts to terminate the journey from time to time by unscrupulous beings. The intellectual leaders have played their part in guiding us to maintain the most precious gift to the humanity, namely, 'eternal vigilance'. These Convocation Addresses, while reflecting the progress we have made in the fields of Science and Technology, have exhorted us to look inwards to find the light that has withstood the ravages of time, eternally burning. Therefore, they have moved beyond the routine academic stock-taking and have included within their frame-work a compendium of ever-shining wisdom.</p>
<p>I am happy to acknowledge the efforts made by my colleagues in bringing out this volume. Dr. C. Naganna, Director of Prasaranga and Professor of Comparative Literature, has been ably assisted by Dr. Harinarayana, Associate Professor of Library and Information Science, Sri Mohan Kumar and Smt. Paduma of the Vice-Chancellor's Secretariat . The help extended by Prof. Mallinath Kumbar in this regard is no less. Sri. S Ananda, the Director of the University Printing Press, has galvanized the support of his staff in making this volume available at a short notice. I record my appreciation of their effort and I am sure they will continue to do the good work.</p>
<p>I remember all my predecessors with gratitude for contributing in their own way to keep up the hallowed tradition of our great University. It is indeed a matter of pride and honour that the volume is being launched by Shri H.D. Devegowda, the former Prime Minister of India, whose association with our University has been a long-standing one. I thank him immensely for this fine gesture since it would go a long way in encouraging us to celebrate the Centenary with pomp and vigilance.</p>
