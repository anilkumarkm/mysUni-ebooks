		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">SEVENTY—FOURTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
		<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong>SHRI ARJUN SINGH</strong><br /> Hon'ble Minister for Human Resource Development<br />Government of India</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Thursday, February 10', 1994﻿</em></p>
		<p><em>Mr. Pro-Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, distinguished members of the university bodies, members of staff and Young Friends,</em></p>
		<p>I am delighted to be on the campus of Mysore University, one of the oldest universities in the country. This University has enjoyed the patronage of the Maharajas of the State and since its establishment has played an important role in promoting the cause of higher education in the country. A number of renowned academicians and statesmen of this country have guided the course of development of the University. It has also produced a large number of alumni who have distinguished themselves at the national and international level.</p>
		<p>I wish the out-going graduates a bright future in their lives. I have no doubt that the training you received here will stand you in good stead and by your accomplishments and success in life, you will bring honour to your alma mater. I would like to if I may, share some views on a few aspects of higher education.</p>
		<p>Despite the massive infrastructure which we have created since independence, the enrolment of the cohort age group in higher education sector is around 6%. This compares very unfavourably with some of the Asian countries which are in a comparable state of industrialisation. Secondly, although we have the third largest scientific and techno-logical stock of manpower in the world, still the overall proportion is only 6 per lakh compared to 70 in South Korea and 190 in Japan. These facts highlight the need for expansion of higher education in our country.</p>
		<p>Though education at all levels contributes to national development, higher education, in particular, assumes significance in promoting national development as it enhances social capabilities among people in terms of higher order knowledge and skills and generating new knowledge necessary for development and self-reliance. It has an important bearing on the nation's economic and technological progress. Accordingly, a country like India cannot afford to neglect its quest to achieve global standards in higher education—both in terms of quantity and quality.</p>
		<p>It is a fact that as on date, higher education is highly subsidised and the Government provides necessary funds for the establishment of colleges/universities as well as for their maintenance. Recognizing the fact that the Government has valid constraints in the face of an all-round resource scarcity and competing demands from other crucial sectors, there is a feeling that alternative resources for higher educa-tion need to be explored. This is not to suggest total privatisation, for in order to protect the interests of weaker sections, promote development and self-reliance, the Government has to play an important role in higher education. International experience too shows that countries which have neglected higher education have depended on other countries for their rapid industrialisation. However, even in developed countries, resources for higher education institutions have come from various sources.</p>
		<p>Studies reveal that even in an affluent country like USA the general public funds constitute about 45% of the total income of the higher education institutions, in Germany it is 68% and in Japan it is about 63%. In India, where the per capita income is low, privatisation of education would deprive a large section of people the access to higher education. It is only the affluent sections of society who can afford to pay the actual cost of education and this would create social inequality.</p>
		<p>The Justice Punnayya Committee appointed by the UGC has said that while Government funding should continue, steps should be taken by the Universities to generate some resources of their own. It has also suggested that the 'negotiated funding' system which has been in vogue all along should be replaced by a more scientific and rational system.</p>
		<p>I feel that it is essential that our colleges and universities develop adequate mechanisms to generate their own income as well as optimise costs. It is possible to use the existing infrastructure to run colleges/universities in a shift system. This will reduce the infrastructural funds for establishing new institutions. Equally important is the need to link research to the needs of Industry and Commerce. This will not only make education more relevant to the needs of our economy, it will lead to better employment prospects for the products of our Universities. This will also lead to greater generation of funds. A beginning has been made in this direction and the Government will encourage all efforts in this area.</p>
		<p>The other alternative strategy which can be adopted to accommodate the future aspirants for access to higher education, is through the distance mode. As on date, there are 5 Open Universities in the country and nearly 44 Universities which have departments of distance education/correspondence education. Unfortunately, distance education is considered inferior in quality to the conventional system. This misgiving can be eliminated if we can provide mobility between the formal and the non-formal systems. In the recently concluded EFA Summit, there was an agreement among all the participating countries that distance education possibly holds the key to the educational break-through we are all seeking. UNESCO too has agreed to participate in a project on this subject. I am hopeful of some tangible progress in the near future.</p>
		<p>While expansion of higher education is a must for the forseeable future, due care is also to be taken to ensure the quality of education. One has to recognise the fact that not all institutions are imparting a comparable standard of education. Thus areas like teacher training and motivation, adhering to academic timetables as well as improving standards of discipline also need to be focussed on. Pandit Nehru had said that if our Universities functioned properly, all would be well with the country.</p>
		<p>My young friends are now leaving this sheltered environment to enter a fast and competitive world. You will have your share of trials and tribulations, to deal with which you will need all the intellectual and ethical resources you have acquired here. I am sure that you will all do very well. You all have my best wishes for a happy and successful life.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">SEVENTY—FOURTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
		<p>By<br /> <strong>DR. A.P.J. ABDUL KALAM</strong><br /> Scientific Adviser to Raksha Mantri<br />and<br /> Secretary, Department of Defense<br />Research &#38; Development</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>February 25th, 1995﻿</em></p>
		<p><strong>1. DARE TO DREAM</strong></p>
		<p>I am indeed delighted and honoured to participate in this 75th Convocation of University of Mysore. I have been thinking about what to share with you on this important occasion when you are entering the most eventful phase of your life after years of learning. I know that for the past twenty years or so you have been continuously taught various aspects by teachers. I am therefore not going to extend this process. Instead, I would like to share with you a few of my experiences, one at a place very close to you and others at Trivandrum and Hyderabad. These are the experiences where people have dared to dream and met with success. Of course, we have to recognise that success is always the result of sweat of individuals and also coupled with many failures. The place close to you is the site of pilgrimage not only for me but for every one who practices rocketry in our country. Let me first tell you something about this.</p>
		<p><strong>2. FIRST WAR ROCKET</strong></p>
		<p>When I was studying in school and college, Srirangapatna interested me for two reasons - the place was the scene of battle against foreign rule and also there was a reference to a new weapon introduced. In 1960, when I visited Srirangapatna with my friends, we were thrilled to walk around this historical town. We searched for the Turukhan-hally fort built during Hyder Ali Tippu Sultan times and used for making rockets, way back in 1794. I had a tremendous I would like to declare today that this land is the birth place disappointment when I did not see any permanent evidence or of war rockets in the world and offer it my reverence and respect. The historical recordings in Srirangapatna regarding creation or tradition continues development of first war rocket in the world.</p>
		<p>Later, in 1963, I was at Wallop's Island, the rocket launch facility of NASA in USA, in connection with a collaborative programme oflaunching of sounding meteorological rockets for research of upper atmosphere. In the lobby of their commandcontrol centre, I saw a prominently displayed picture. The war dress and the colour of the soldiers' skin attracted my attention. Some dark complexioned soldiers were firing rockets on their white skinned opponents. The label on the painting read, “The world's first war rocket”. It was indeed a great pleasure to see an Indian feat acknowledged on the other side of the planet. I felt excited with happiness.</p>
		<p>I started reading the history of rockets. I had a dream I must see Tippu's rockets. Time continued to pass. Rocket technology engulfed me and India's first satellite launch vehicle SLV-3 was launched. In 1980, we had an opportunity to visit London. There, I saw two of the war rockets captured by British at Srirangapatna, displayed at Museum of Artillery at Woolwich in London with heading “India's War Rocket". Probably Europe learnt rocketry from our Srirangapatna rocket in the eighteenth century! It was a great thrill to see an Indian innovation on a foreign soil, well preserved and with facts not distorted.</p>
		<p>I got the performance of these 2 kg rockets, 50 mm in dia. and about 250 mm in length analysed by our designers. What a simple and elegant design, effectively used in war! Surely HyderTippu Sultan would have had talented men who could look at propulsion, material, ignition, and build rockets and fly them for war operations. In fact, when we look back to eighteenth century ambience, it is a technology marvel.</p>
		<p>I would like to declare today that this land is the birth place of war rockets in the world and offer it my reverence and respect. The tradition continues.</p>
		<p><strong>3. PROF. VIKRAM SARABHAI: MAN OF VISION</strong></p>
		<p>Nations advance along the course charted by great dreamers. Let me narrate to you an incidence which occurred in 1968. We were working on the configuration of India's satellite launch vehicle in Thumba. One day, Prof. Vikram Sarabhai, the then Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), brought Prof. Curien, President, CNES, France, to our laboratory. France was developing Diamont Satellite Launch Vehicles at that time. After focusing on our planned efforts, as an almost spontaneous reaction, Prof. Sarabhai proposed that we should fly India's fourth stage of SLV-3 as the Diamont's fourth stage. We had not flown even a meteorological rocket by that time, but Prof. Sarabhai was aware of the possibilities and trusted the capabilities of his team. His dream of SLV-3 fourth stage getting into a French launch vehicle finally came true in the form of apogee boost motor for APPLE satellite, flown by ARIANE, the European launch vehicle. This is the vision! He gave us a 15 year jump in our efforts. With three experimental Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS) in orbit and their images being received in the USA, Satellite Ground Stations with Indian Satellite Launch Vehicle PSLV launching our own satellite from our own land, his dream visualized in 1965 has taken form through the people born at different times. Nations are thus built by men of vision who dream and prepare ground for the coming generations.</p>
		<p><strong>4. SUPER COMPUTERAND PARALLEL PROCESSING</strong></p>
		<p>In 1986, Dr. V.S. Arunachalam and myself went to US to buy a Super Computer with 400 mega flop speed. The Deputy Secretary in the Dept of Defence at Pentagon first put us into long series of technical discussions and then regretted the sale on the pretext that we will use it to develop long range missiles detrimental to the security interests of the world. Travelling back disappointed, Dr Arunachalam said, “Let us make our own Super Computer". Today, India has a 32 node 1000 M Flops PACE SPARC 10 machine available for other countries to buy. Once we decide, we work and realise even tough dreams. That is what India expects from you.</p>
		<p>A team of young scientists and engineers under the leadership of Dr. G. Venkataraman formed ANURAG, i.e., Advanced Numerical Research and Analysis Group, to develop a parallel processing computer specially for aircraft design. At that time AGNI also was taking shape. The payload of AGNI would re-enter the atmosphere at 15 times the speed of sound. Even at this speed we had to keep the vehicle under control and while the payload outer temperature goes to 3000 degrees centigrade, inside of payload the ambient has to be less than 30 degrees centigrade. We have in India supersonic wind tunnel. We needed hypersonic wind tunnel for designing the AGNI payload. Varoius wind tunnel data could provide the loads experienced during the re-entry phase of the system. There were tunnels abroad but once they knew the application, they were refused.</p>
		<p>This time our high-tech academic institutions rose to the occasion. Prof S.M. Deshpande of Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) with five young bright fresh scientists from DRDL with background of mathematics and fluid dynamics, developed Computational Fluid Dynamics Software for Hypersonic Regimes in just six months. This software is the original contribution with minimum computational facility available in the world. No country would have given us this type of software. But it was done through optimum partitioning, sequencing and paralleling the task. This software solution has established that brainpower, excels manmade machines, even super computers.</p>
		<p>I have seen that India can build her own super computer; India can fly its own rocket system within and outside the country. Both the dreams have come out of visions. This convocation ambience where hundreds of young graduates are entering their professional lives is ideal for thinking about the need of visions for the next two decades. What could they be?</p>
		<p><strong>5. VISION FOR THE NATION</strong></p>
		<p>With the growing population, increasing unemployment, unaffordable medical care, and changing value system, our society is going through certain turbulent situation. The society looks forward to prosperity. In a decade, or two, prosperity and good life is possible if the nation has the vision. Vision generates progress. As an example, we can study the period between 1857 and 1947; it was the vision of freedom which not only got us independence but during the same period in India, vision of independence generated many leaders of excellence in politics, philosophy, history, science and technology and industry. Again, can we dream for a vision to make this nation great - a nation with prosperity and peace?</p>
		<p><strong>6. ENLIGHTENED CITIZENS</strong></p>
		<p>The vision of “Enlightened Citizens” calls for a mission of integrating education, occupation and health care as one single entity. For development of self, society and nation, it is essential that hundreds of clusters of villages are divided into multiple blocks of 20,000 families. And each block can be considered as a progress group with certain number of hospitals, schools and agriculture farms which could be growing cash crops, aromatic plants, or fish farms. The experience in Kerala and Tamilnadu indicates that integration of education and occupation resulted in small families, in addition to promoting self sustained good life. This enlightened citizen package can be extended to the whole country.</p>
		<p><strong>7. NETWORKING OF MAJOR RIVERS</strong></p>
		<p>We recently conducted a workshop on the subject based on Dr. K.L. Rao's report "National Water Grid” and Capt. Dastur's proposal of “Garland Canal”. This has all the dimensions of becoming an important vision for the nation. Nation can aim at linking multiple rivers resulting in water distribution, flood/drought control, navigation and power generation. Above all, this will bring together the country as it happened during the independence movement, with potential revolution in agricultural output and employment generation. Experts have indicated that this is the right time to take this as a major programme as technology exists today and the country has the capability to finance such a programme. Today we have: satellite mapping of water resources and river-flow aspects; capability to use nuclear energy for large tunneling in mountains to direct the river flows, and technological strength in mechanical, civil and communication engineering. It may be a 20-year program for the nation.</p>
		<p><strong>ENERGY EVERYWHERE</strong></p>
		<p>Similarly the third area is “Energy Everywhere”. We believe by year 2000 plus, we will have to generate almost 50% more power. Probably, we will have to look for environment clean power. In addition to hydro and thermal energy, the nonconventional energy and nuclear energy has to contribute to power generation for which technological innovation is essential. Even hydro and thermal energy would need newer technologies so that they can provide affordable electrical energy.</p>
		<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
		<p>Friends! Vision for the Nation is in front of you. These dreams are bigger than the individual or group of people. Great things do not just occur; you have to dream about them and work to realize them. You can be a partner to the visions for the country and begin to experience dreams coming true. What you are is God's gift to you. What you make out of yourself will be your gift to God. I wish you a challenging profession in your respective fields and recall the famous lines:</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">SEVENTY-SIXTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
		<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong> Hon'ble Mr. Justice A. M. AHMADI</strong><br /><em>Chief Justice of India</em></p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Saturday, March 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1996﻿</em></p>
		<p><em>Your Excellency Shri Khurshed Alam Khan, Governor of Karnataka and Chancellor of the Mysore University, Shri D. Manjunath,, Honble Minister for Higher Education of Karnataka and Pro-Chancellor of the University, Prof. M. Madaiah, Vice-Chancellor, the Hon'ble members of the Senate and the Syndicate of the University, Deans of various faculties, dear students, ladies and gentlemen,</em></p>
		<p>I consider it a great privilege to have been invited to deliver the Convocation Add ress at this august university which has produced great sons of the soil. Scholars like Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Sardar K.M. Panikkar, Shri. R.K. Narayan have been associated with this university. Established in 1916 a galaxy of eminent personalities like Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Dr. Annie Besant, Dr. Zakir Hussain, Pt. Kunjru and Rev. C. F. Andrews to name just a few have addressed the students of this university in the past. Every university is a place of learning where the pursuit of knowledge is ever continuing. The teachers are only senior students in the sense that their pursuit of learning started a few years before that of the students. The students who have just graduated or received some higher degree or diploma will not cease to be students. Education is a continuous process and has to continue whether one is attending formal classes or is pursuing some profession or career. Convocations can, therefore, be described as milestones of a long journey where we stop to assess the progress made so far. Convocations are also occasions when we assess the distance to be covered before the goal is reached.</p>
		<p>The large segment of our people still suffers from illiteracy. The proportion of people who are graduates and can be called highly educated is still very small. Therefore, you are amongst the fortunate few of this country. You constitute the intelligentsia of the country. You must, therefore, always remember that you have certain obligations and responsibilities towards the society. While you have your own aspirations and ambitions to achieve, the society also has its expectations which you must satisfy. These expectations are not static but are ever changing and ever demanding. The only permanent feature in the history of human civilization has been change'. Old order yieldeth to new. Every new generation has to take over the responsibilities from the previous one. It is for this reason that a serious thought has to be given to the role that each one of you must assign to yourself to be pursued in the days to come. On the one hand you will have responsibilities towards your own families, your parents and the younger generation yet to come. At the same time as responsible citizens you have a very important role to play in the development of the nation. Education is a primary requirement in the building up of a man's personality. Every citizen has to assume and realise the role that he or she has to play.</p>
		<p>The people in a society can be of four different types as expounded by Bhartrihari in the 6th century A.D. In verse 64 of Niti Sataka he says:</p>
		<p>“There is one type of people called the Sat-purusha (good people), who sacrifice their own interest and work for the welfare of other people; the next group consists of the general (Samanya), the generality or the majority who also work for the welfare of other people but without sacrificing their own self-interest the third group is of the demons among men (manava rakshasas) who destroy other people's welfare in order to gain their own self interest; but the fourth group on the contrary—alas, I do not know what to call them—destroy other people's welfare, even without gaining anything for themselves”.</p>
		<p>In every society the people of the first type are in minority while the second are in majority. If, however education and national character is debased then the people of the third and the fourth category swell in number. Self interest and social interest are complementary to each other. If self-interest gets an upper hand then very soon it will defeat itself, because with a society going backward no individual who is its member can expect to march forward. The nation will cease to develop and progress. Remember, therefore, that you will have to place the interest of the nation above self-interest. That should be the first and foremost consideration as you step out in the open world to start a new chapter in life.</p>
		<p>Education is not simply acquisition of knowledge and information; expected to build the character of students and make them good citizens. In fact education devoid of character can lead to dangerous results. Bertrand Russell said. “With every increase in knowledge and skill wisdom becomes more necessary; for every such increase augments our capacity for evil if our purpose is unwise”. The famous psychologist William Mcdougal in his book “Character and Conduct of Life” said that young people must have ambition but the ambition must be yoked to a great ideal of life, at great ideal of character, otherwise their ambition will make them unscrupulous. He said - ambition working alone tends to produce an unscrupulous man for scruple often stands in the way of ambition.” Be ambitious, aspire to achieve heights, but not at the cost of the nation and society and that is what is meant when I say that you will have to learn to suppress self-interest ifit conflicts with national or societal interest.</p>
		<p>Character is but a set of values that one assimilates in one's personality and which reflects in one's every day behaviour. When we use the word character' the first value that comes to our mind is honesty and sincerity. The other most important component will be love and tolerance.</p>
		<p>Love is a unique virtue that finds satisfaction in giving without expecting any returns. if we love only when we are loved in return, love degenerates into a commercial transaction. In practical life, service to others is an outer expression of love in one's inner heart. For long we have talked of tolerance which makes it possible for peoples of different hues to live together. But we can convert the word tolerance into a more positive concept of understanding, acceptance and mutual respect. Mutual understanding and respect has been an age-old value which, in our country, has not simply been found in books but has been practised in everyday life by the common people.</p>
		<p>India is one country where the leading religions of the world have converged, thrived and flourished and with the strands of these religions, this diversity, we have woven a fine tapestry for ourselves. It should be the endeavour of each one of us to see that we do not damage this beautiful tapestry woven over a period of time or disturb the fine mosaic of humanity which we have reason to be proud of. The ethos built around our civilisation and culture has unquestionably been of a composite identity and has depicted a unique homogeneity. Even though there have been disturbances in one corner of the country or another in the name of religion which have tarnished the fair name of our country, fortunately since the tapestry is made of strong strands, our unity has survived because we as a nation have always believed in tolerance which makes our unity strong. Our culture and creed is tolerance and this is deeply ingrained in us notwithstanding efforts by the third and the fourth category of people to tear it apart.</p>
		<p>In the Preamble of our Constitution we have resolved to promote amongst ourselves fraternity, assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation. Fraternity obliterates the distinction of caste, class or creed so that every individual is allowed to live in dignity. At the same time, however, the unity and integrity of the nation is of supreme importance. In moments of crisis our country has shown remarkable unity as well as a sense of integrity. The feeling of oneness, should become a part of our social ethos. True fraternity will come when as social beings we accept that every citizen or member of the society is entitled to the same dignity as ourselves and since we have to live together—whether as a nation or as a world community our happiness lies in realising and accepting that others have the same right to life and liberty as we claim for ourselves.</p>
		<p>The other very important corollary of education is culture. Education by itself cannot produce culture and not all educated people can call themselves cultured. Tagore while explaining the difference between education and culture compared education with the precious stone of diamond while culture with the light it reflects. He said that the stone has weight while the light has glow. There is no greater wealth - than wisdom; no greater poverty than ignorance; no greater heritage than culture (Nahjul Balagha, saying 52). India has a history of over 5000 years and throughout our history we find that our culture has never been to worship or revere materialistic wealth or power. In this country the kings have worshipped the saints. Saints who were not only wise but also selfless, commanded as much reverence as God. This is our cultural heritage. Revere wisdom, revere selflessness, not wealth or political power.</p>
		<p>Today, after nearly 50 years of freedom and despite the efforts made for socio-economic development, we find ourselves lagging behind many nations who acquired independence almost simultaneously with us. The economic backwardness is apparent and does not call for any emphasis but even in social development we have lagged behind many small countries of the world. We may quite find ourselves in a state of dejection but that cannot be any answer to the problem. If we have to be equal to the task the one thing that we must have is commitment to the cause and this commitment can be realised by hard work. This commitment is not for any political ideology or for a group, it has to be to the nation and for a right cause. This commitment can come with a sense of involvement, with a feeling that we work for the nation. With commitment and hard work it becomes necessary to ensure a proper moti-vation. The motivating force, undoubtedly, must be service before self. The profit-making or the power-motive limits one's capacity to strive. In the history of human civilization we will not find any character who has excelled being driven by the motive of money or power. The motive must have a spiritual dimension and only then will it give us strength and drive to work hard and with devotion and dedication. Evolution of the human specie has not been only biological evolution. It has a psychosocial and a spiritual dimension. The ultimate craving for man either in individual or social life is emancipation and real emancipation can come only when we fulfill this spiritual dimension</p>
		<p>Freedom is normally understood in the social and political sense but it has a psychological aspect as well. Without being really free within our own minds we cannot appreciate the value of social and political freedom. “The heaven of freedom“ as described by Tagore will be a place where knowledge is free”, “where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls”, “where a clear stream of reason has not lost its way into dreary desert, of dead habits”. If we can raise our minds to this level of freedom we can call ourselves universal men and women. Benjamin Franklin expressed his concept of liberty in the following words:</p>
		<p>“God grant that not only the love of liberty But a thorough knowledge of the rights of man may pervade all nations of the earth, so that A philosopher may set his foot anywhere on its surface, and say, This is my country”.</p>
		<p>It must be a day of rejoicing for all those receiving degrees today. Some of you may continue with further studies. For most of you, however, it is an end of the scholastic career and the beginning of a new one. I most heartily congratulate you for successful completion of your university days. I wish in the days to come you will step from glory to glory and hold the name of your alma mater high. Some of you have earned laurels for yourselves in scholastic pursuits: others may not have fared too well. However, we must remember that examination results are not a final measure of a person's ability to succeed in life. It is well-known that academic careers of many great men were not bright. Equally true is the fact that the success in a university examination will soon be forgotten unless the future career of a student is matched with similar achievement. A degree is merely an entry pass to enter the competition of life but it is no guarantee for success. It undoubtedly gives satisfaction that your strenuous efforts have borne fruit and that you have acquired basic knowledge in a discipline of your choice. That gives you the strength and confidence to face the odds ahead. You would be leaving the portals of the university with a sense of satisfaction but let that not make you complacent towards what awaits you as you cross the threshold and prepare to meet the challenges of life. It certainly will give a boost to your capacity to strive, for you are about to enter another fresh arena of competition.</p>
		<p>Here one needs to pause and think as to what is life? And, what is success? Please do not equate life with your job and success with the amount of money you are able to earn. Think of life as a holistic concept. As you grow older newer and newer facets of life will unfold themselves, Life is but a series of problems that confront you and call upon you to resolve. Henry I Kaiser said : “Problems are only opportunities in work clothes.” Therefore, face the problems of life with a sports person's spirit and look upon every new situation as an opportunity to better your previous records. Success is not measured in terms of the amount of money or fame or power earned and enjoyed; real success lies in a feeling of satisfaction in having lived the life well or in one's ability to live upto one's own principles and ideals. I wish all of you future life and hope that you will make the best of whatever life has to offer to you. May God help you.</p>
		<p>Thank you for your time.﻿</p>

		<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong>Dr. K. KASTURI RANGAN</strong><br /> Secretary, Department of Space &#38; Chairman, Space<br />Commission<br /> Government of India</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Monday, April 21<sup>st</sup>, 1997﻿</em></p>
		<p><em>Your Excellency Shri Khurshed Alam Khan, Governor of Karnataka and the Chancellor. Shri Somashekar, Hon'ble Minister for Higher Education and Pro-Chancellor. Prof. Madaiah, Vice Chancellor, Honie Members of the Senate and Syndicate, distinguished members of the faculty, my dear young graduates, ladies and gentlemen.</em></p>
		<p>I deem it a great honour and privilege to deliver the 77th Convocation address of this esteemed university in the historic city of Mysore. The role which this city and this region have played in the social, economic, cultural and political development of our country is very significant. The very name, Mysore, is reminiscent of the mythological story of the fall of Mahishasura and, through that, the idea of the supremacy of righteousness in life. No wonder that this city received rich patronage from successful dynasties including Pallavas, Gangas, Cholas, Hoysalas and Vijayanagar Emperors who ruled this region for centuries. In more recent past, Mysore has been the seat of one of the most enlightened royal dynasties who encouraged scholarship and fine arts; Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar-III established the Raja's Free School in 1833, the nucleus of the now famous Maharaja College. It is noteworthy that Mysore has also produced an array of illustrious musicians, composers, musicologists and dancers. The heritage of this region in the fields of painting, craft and sculpture is well known. This place is not only the cradle of Kannada literature but also has made significant contribution to Sanskrit, English and Telugu literature. Mysore is one of the finest examples for interweaving art with life which is the hallmark of oriental civilizations.</p>
		<p>In the technical arena too, Mysore has a pride of place, thanks to the pioneering role played by the great engineer, industrialist, administrator and statesman, Sri Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, it is no exaggeration if I say that the seeds of space technology were sown in this soil much before the modern space era began in the world. Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan used rockets as part of their artillery which had a devastating impact on the British army; two of the Tippu's rockets are displayed in Royal artillery museum in London.</p>
		<p>Befitting the historical heritage of this region, your University has a long tradition of producing and nurturing eminent persons who served our country and added new chapters to the history of modern India. Illustrious personalities like Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Dr. K.V. Puttappa, Prof. G.P. Rajaratnam and Shri R.K. Narayan who have been part of the academic life of this university bear ample testimony to this. Therefore, you have been fortunate to grow your academic career in such a rich ambience. Let me take this opportunity to warmly congratulate you, my young friends, for the proud privilege of graduating from this esteemed university. Today is a red letter day in your life. It is my fervent wish that each one of you, through assimilation of the education you obtained here, achieve success in your chosen careers and add glory to this university.</p>
		<p>My dear young friends, our country will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary of independence beginning this August. We should not, however, forget that fifty years is a short period in the history of this land which is the seat of an ancient civilization. This civilization which in its very dawn was lighted up by the spark of the thought for experiencing the essential significance of life had unique contributions to the world throughout its long period of existence. We should not be oblivious of this rich inheritance and we should make every effort to preserve and benefit from this. However, this can be effectively done only when we could get rid of poverty and improve the quality of life of an average citizen. These are the primary tasks for our times. The fiftieth anniversary of our independence could be a fitting occasion to take stock of our achievements and determine our future directions.</p>
		<p>Looking at the challenges we had to face in the postindependence era, we can be proud that we have preserved the integrity of our nation in spite of social, cultural, religious, economic and linguistic diversities. We achieved self-sufficiency in food grain production, increasing it from a mere 55 million tonnes at the time of independence to about 190 million tonnes today, thanks to the green revolution. In the past five decades, the literacy rate has been improved from 16 percent to 53 percent. The improved health care resulted in the extension of the average life span from 30 years to 60 years. Great strides have been taken in the development of a highly diversified national industry with considerable technological strengths. We made sustained progress in building elaborate infrastructure including one of the largest networks of railways in the world. Our academic institutions have produced brilliant professionals who are sought after even by advanced countries. Further, we scored noteworthy achievements in several areas of science and technology.</p>
		<p>Notwithstanding such significant achievements, it is not difficult for us to observe that 'we have a long way to go to ensure a new quality of life to every Indian. The exponential increase in our population from a level of 36 crores in 1951 to over 93 crores at present has neutralized the benefits of advances made in every other field. Eradication of illiteracy in rural areas, where more than 70 percent of our population resides, is still a big challenge. There is a further need to develop modern infrastructure in areas like power, communications and transport. Indeed, it is hard to complete the list of our priority needs and I do not venture to do that. Suffice to say that our task of building a self sustained, vibrant and harmoniously developed society is far from complete.</p>
		<p>When we consider the task of our nation building, we cannot merely look at the present day problems but we should consider the future needs also. Looking from this perspective, we have to contend with some formidable challenges. We will have to increase our food grains production from the present level of about 190 million tonnes to 220 million tonnes to meet the needs of the projected population by the turn of the century. The current projections indicate that the country's population may stabilize at 1.8 billion around AD 2060, calling for an annual food production of about 400 million tonnes. As the expansion of arable land by the same proportion is not possible, we have to substantially increase the yield per hectare, which is presently about 1.6 tonnes on the average.</p>
		<p>Management of water resources is another major area of concern; most of the precipitation occurs in about three months in the dry land tracts, resulting in low soil moisture for the rest of the year. Silting of water reservoirs and high rate of water runoff are major issues to be dealt with. Our exploitation of ground water has resulted in depletion of static water table at an alarming rate in many places. Our large coastline faces peculiar problems of coastal zone environmental degradation. The mangrove forests which act as effective barriers against coastal erosion have been denuded by almost 80 percent over the last 100 years. Natural disasters such as cyclone, floods and droughts cause recurring damage which claim many lives and result in huge loss of property.</p>
		<p>The magnitude and complexity of these problems point to the inevitable need for using a scientific approach combined with effective human organization for their solution. Further, as we are tackling the problems of our development, we can hardly ignore the rapid changes in the world scenario in several fields. We see that an exponential growth is taking place in science and technology, particularly in fields like transportation, telecommunications, information and bio-technology. These have also been making tremendous impact on the economic and cultural relations among the nations of the world. On one side of the globe, we have countries that have taken advantage of their early entry in industrial revolution and benefited by rapidly adding wealth to their economies. On the other side, we have a larger group of nations, which are over-burdened by rapidly growing population, with predominantly agrarian economies and constrained by poverty and lack of technological resources. Differing political ideologies have also created divisions and alignments among nations and influenced their economic and trade relations. The wealthy nations have found sizable markets for their manufactured goods in the developing countries, who have often supplied them with minerals and raw materials at low cost. As technologies relevant for exploiting resources are in the possession of large multi-national corporations belonging to developed countries, they have a large share of the world trade, because of these economic practices and in water management methods to ensure sustained increase in productivity.</p>
		<p>Now turning to the other component of Indian Space Programme, development of launch capability is extremely important. The initial developments in small sounding rockets and the first Satellite Launch Vehicle SLV-3 paved the way for taking up more complex programmes, viz, capability for near-earth missions through ASLV, launching IRS satellites through PSLV and geosynchronous INSAT satellites using GSLV. We have been quite successful in this difficult area. Today we have the operational capability through PSLV and soon, we plan to complete the development of GSLV.</p>
		<p>Technological excellence and credibility established by Indian in space programme can be judged from the fact that S11-EOSAT, a US based company, has a commercial contract with the Department of Space to receive and market worldwide the data from India's IRS satellites. There are two stations operating outside India-one in the US and the other in Germany for receiving IRS data. Several more stations all over the globe will join this endeavour. The international telecommunication satellite organization, INTELSAT has entered into a contract with India for leasing transponders from India's INSAT-2E on a commercial basis. Our PSLV, after its two consecutive successful flights, has now potential to provide commercial launch services.</p>
		<p>Strong linkages with the users academics and industry has been the hallmark of Indian Space Programme. The Indian industry, the academic institutions and research institutions have been participating in the space efforts, in a major way. I am sure that some of you will get an opportunity to contribute to the space efforts directly or indirectly in the years to come.</p>
		<p>These spectacular achievements in Space Programme and their effective utilization have been the result of concerted and dedicated efforts of a number of young men and women drawn from all over the country. The challenges ahead of us in space are manifold. Space offers quite satisfying and rewarding professional career for young scientists, techno-logists and managers.</p>
		<p>My dear young graduates, the enviable capability which we have built up under the space programme has been possible because of the dedicated efforts of scientists, engineers, administrators and others. In fact, the execution of space programme requires personnel from almost all disciplines such as science and technology, social sciences, economics and Management. Space missions demand team work and synergy of multiple disciplines. The people who are responsible for these achievements in our space programme are product of our own universities. It is important to note that when we started our space programme, we hardly had any experience in designing and developing space hardware or software. It is through sheer hard work and determination that our people learnt the art and today in some fields of space, we created our own niche of global leadership. I should, of course, caution you that these successes are not without going through several trials and tribulations. The three decades of space efforts establish that given a clear cut goal and encouragement, our youth can achieve excellent results and we can be second to none in the mastery of high technology.</p>
		<p>It is you, my dear young graduates, who will decide the destiny of this country and its nearly one billion population. It is pointed out that the most creative works of scientists all over the globe came out in their young age. So, I wish to tell young friends, that the present phase of our life is very important. not only to shape your own future, but also to improve our society. You are at the threshold of lacing the world with all its uncertainties and challenges. You will also realise that the purpose of education is not just memorising some facts and reproducing them in an examination. It also includes development of your capability for deep thinking and imbibing the high values of our culture, so that you shape the future civilisation. Education should provide you with a discipline to face the rigous of practical life and confidence to deal with complex situations. In that sense, education is an incessant process of finding perfection in ourselves. Hence, the process of education does not stop with the university Degree; it continues throughout one's life.</p>
		<p>Before I conclude, I am tempted to recall the speech delivered at the very first convocation of this University on October 19, 1918, by His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore in which he had quoted some eloquent words of Mr. Asquith in a Rectorial Address:</p>
		<p>“Keep always with you, whatever your course may lie, the best and the most enduring gift that a University can bestow - the company of great thoughts, the inspiration of great ideals, the example of great failures - so equipped, you can face without perturbation the buffets of circumstance, the caprice of fortune, all the inscrutable vicissitudes of life”.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">SEVENTY-EIGHTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
		<p class="text-center">By<br /> <strong>PROF. G.J.V. JAGANNADHA RAJU</strong><br /><em> Chancellor, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Viswa<br />Mahavidyalaya<br /> (Deemed-to-be-University)<br /> Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu</em></p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Monday, February 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1998﻿</em></p>
		<p><em>Your Excellency Sri Khurshed Alam Khan, Governor of Karnataka and the Chancellor, Sri H. G. Govinda Gowda, Hon'ble Minister for Higher Education and Pro-Chancellor, Prof. S.N. Hegde, Vice-Chancellor, Distinguished Members of University Authorities and Faculty, Graduates of the year, Ladies and Gentlemen:</em></p>
		<p>I am indeed grateful to the Chancellor and the ViceChancellor for inviting me to address the 78th Annual Convocation of this renowned University. I deem it an honour. As the oldest University in the State of Karnataka established in the year 1916, it served as a beacon of light and instrument for social and economic changes; its contributions to the development of education in the region and in the generation and dissemination of knowledge have been very significant.</p>
		<p>Education is not mere transfer or acquisition of knowledge. Ideally, it performs the function of training the mind to analyse and utilise the knowledge acquired for the benefit of the individual and the community around or the nation at large. It should transform one's own thoughts, emotions, impulses and intuition into meaningful goals, rational decisions, disciplined conduct and enlightened behaviour. Education should emancipate an individual from dogma and superstition. The main function of education is the development of human resources for bringing about appropriate and effective socio-economic changes. The success of the higher education system in the country can be gauged from the extent of attainment of these goals and objectives. In the words of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru,<strong>“The University stands for humanism, for tolerance, for reason, for the adventure of ideas and for the search of truth. It stands for the onward march of the human race towards even higher objectives. If the universities discharge their duties adequately, then it is well with the nation and the people.”</strong></p>
		<p>Populous nations like India can look upon their teeming millions as national wealth provided adequate attention is paid to the development of their human resources through education. This may entail huge expansion of the existing facilities and infrastructure at various levels of the educational pyramid. In 1947, when India got its independence, there were only 19 universities and 636 colleges with a student enrolment of about one lakh six thousand. Since then, there has been tremendous upsurge in the demand for higher education resulting in a and colleges. Today there are over 220 universities and university — level institutions and about 8,500 colleges. The annual growth rate is about 5 per cent. The student population is around five million and there are over three lakh teachers. We have institutions with different types of management/organisation structures. There are Central Universities, Institutions of national importance, State Universities, Institutions deemed to be Universities, Regional Colleges, Government Colleges, Aided Colleges, Unaided Colleges and Self-financing Colleges. Some of the institutions are comparable with the best in the rest of the world. The unprecedented expansion, particularly during the last decade, has resulted in the mushrooming of institutions in higher education breeding mediocrity. The situation calls for immediate initiation of remedial measures. If attention is focussed on the challenges of 21st Century, the magnitude of the problem gets accentuated not only in terms of ever-increasing numbers but also in terms of emerging areas for which timely and careful planning is imperative. The success of higher education system depends on the performance of the universities which in turn depend mainly on the management of the institutions. We have today Indian Administrative Service, Indian Foreign Service, Indian Forest Service, Indian Police Service but unfortunately there is no Indian Education Service.</p>
		<p>The remnants of affiliating university system handed over to us by our colonial rulers still remain with us although it has outlived its utility and has been abandoned in the country of its origin. In spite of the fact that it has lost its relevance and has become unwieldy, more and more affiliated colleges are being added year after year to these universities with no limit in sight. Dislocations in the academic calendar and student agitations for dilution of academic regulations and consequent deterioration of standards are some of the manifestations of the evils brought in by unlimited growth of affiliated colleges. This problem merits serious consideration.</p>
		<p>The document "National Policy on Education" of 1986 envisaged introduction of the system of autonomous colleges with a view to gradually dispense with the affiliating system. It is amusing to note that only a few colleges opted for autonomous status. What does this imply? Does it not show reluctance on the part of teachers and education managers to shoulder greater responsibility in the interest of improving education system? Are they afraid of implied insistence on accountability? This leads us to believe that majority of the managements of the affiliated colleges do not have the confidence that these institutions can survive on their own reputation. It is a pity that they should need the umbrella of the University to establish the credibility of the quality of their products. Unless this is done away with the higher education system cannot deliver the goods expected of it. Abolition of the affiliation system is inevitable some day or the other and the sooner this is realized the better. No one expects this major task to be achieved overnight. Apparently much thoughts has not been given for the strategy to be adopted for the introduction of the requisite changes to replace the out-moded affiliation system. Educationists will have to focus their attention on this problem and draw an action-plan to implement it at least in stages.</p>
		<p>Many are skeptical about the ability of educational administrator to maintain quality in autonomous institutions. This is a major challenge. The misconception that autonomy and accountability are incompatible may be responsible, to a large extent, for this skepticism. Accountability means that the colleges are responsible for establishing their credibility by conducting their affairs so that the outcome fulfils their goals and objectives. A structural framework which ensures quality in such institutions by means of suitable methodology for regular and periodical <strong>selfassessment of institutional effectiveness</strong> needs to be evolved. Academic quality is reflected in complicated and interactive operations which involve the students, faculty, facilities, resources and internal atmosphere within which people work together for the overall growth and progress of the institution. To quantify and measure academic quality is therefore, an intricate task.</p>
		<p>The traditional approaches to define and measure academic quality, according to Austin, are nihilist, reputational, resources, outcomes and value-added. “The <strong>nihilist approach</strong> contends that quality cannot be defined and measured. The <strong>reputational approach</strong> is based on consensus of opinion and is measured in terms of student selectivity, enrolment size and size of graduate faculty. The <strong>resources approach</strong> is defined and measured in terms of highly trained and prestigious faculty, institutional affluence and bright students. The <strong>outcomes approach</strong> is based on the quality of degree recipients in terms of employment, earnings and important positions obtained. Value-added is the institution's ability to affect its students favourably in their intellectual and personal development. <strong>Value-added</strong> approach typically examines actual or inferred changes in students' performance over a period of time. When the introduction of assessment of institutional effectiveness is contemplated, the purpose for which the assessment is being carried out is bound to have powerful influence on the methodology to be adopted and the type of problems that are likely to arise. The purpose could be either enhancement of teaching and learning or accountability to management/external body or both. For any programme of institutional assessment to be successful, mobilising support from members of faculty, in particular, is vitally important. Faculty reservations stem from the fear of being negatively evaluated or from the belief that the outcome of institutions is inherently unmeasurable. The fears of the faculty can be allayed to a large extent by openly acknowledging the inadequacy of measuring any single outcome and by ensuring that multiple measures are incorporated in the assessment process. It should be made clear that the assessment is meant to serve as an instrument for individual and institutional improvement and not as a search for documentation on the basis of which the teacher can be penalised or the programmes can be wound up. The most effective method of accomplishing teachers' acceptability would perhaps, be to involve the faculty in designing the assessment process.</p>
		<p>I have dealt at length on the <strong>assessment of institutional effectiveness</strong> which forms an important part of measures required for <strong>quality improvement</strong> in higher education. A significant development that has taken place in recent years, in the arena of higher education in India, is the introduction of <strong>accreditation</strong>. The concept is somewhat new to the Indian situation. Accreditation implies a process of giving credit where it is due to some clearly visible and demonstrable strengths in academic activities. Accreditation connotes <strong>quality assurance.</strong> It indicates the level of achievement of academic aims and objectives of the programmes offered in the institution and the capability of the institution to ensure continued effectiveness over a specified period. Accreditation serves the purpose of assisting the prospective students, parents, teachers, educational institutions, professional organisations, potential employers and governmental agencies in identifying those institutions and their specific programmes which meet the current norms and standards as well as other specified duality indicators.</p>
		<p>The assessment process can be deliberately designed to be transparent by appraising the institution of its strengths and weaknesses, thereby enabling the managements to improve the quality in existing programmes and development of new programmes. It stimulates the process of bringing about continual improvement in educational programmes/institutions in the country. Accreditation has become a matter of serious concern in view of alarming proliferation of institutions without proper planning resulting in deterioration in standards. Grading of professional institution programmes on the basis of quality is a dire necessity. The major parameters for accreditation of programmes/institution are <strong>Mission Goals and Organisation; Financial and Physical Resources, Human Resources</strong> (faculty and staff), Students (admission criteria and performance), <strong>Teaching-Learning Process, Supplemental Processes</strong> (extra. and co-curricular activities, student counselling, professional society activities, entrepreneurship development, almuni information, campus recruit-ment, training and placement), <strong>Linkages/Interactions and Research and Development.</strong> Weightages are to be assigned for various parameters based on their relative importance.</p>
		<p>To carry out the accreditation process, two apex bodies -<strong> National Assessment and Accreditation Council and National Board of Accreditation</strong> - have been set up by the Univerity Grants Commission and All India Council for Technical Education respectively, the latter being responsible for assessing exclusively professional courses. It is hoped that the impact of accreditation process will be perceivable in the near future. Accreditation will gain greater significance as autonomy is conferred on more and more of the affiliated colleges.</p>
		<p>Before I conclude, let me address exclusively the degree recipients.</p>
		<p>You should be proud of this great University which has oriented you to enter the world of work. You must remember that you owe a great deal to your University and to the Nation.</p>
		<p>You are one among the privileged few to receive the benefit of higher education and by receiving the degree today, you have earned the passport to enjoy further privileges. You have gone through the system which was built by the contributions made by your countrymen, many of whom and whose children are not beneficiaries of the higher education system. Please remember that you are indebted to them and each of you has an obligation - a moral obligation - to fulfil by serving the society in turn to repay your debt. You have to pledge that you will dedicate yourself for improving the quality of life of our people. In this context, let me remind you of one of the observations of Albert Einstien, <strong>“A hundred times a day, I remind myself that my inner and outer life depend upon the labours of other men, living and dead, that I must exert myself in order to live in the same manner as I have received and I am receiving”.</strong></p>
		<p>I wish you all a place of honour in the society, success and happiness.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">SEVENTY-NINTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
		<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong> PROF. R. A. MASHELKAR</strong> Director General. CSIR &#38; Secretary,<br /> Government of India <br /> Department of Scientific &#38; Industrial Research,<br />New Delhi</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Friday, February 26<sup>th</sup>, 1999﻿</em></p>
		<p><em>Your Excellency Sri Khurshed Alam Khan, the Governor of Karnataka and the Chancellor, Sir. Basavaraj Patil Attur, Hon'ble Minister for Higher Education and Pro-Chancellor, Prof. S.N. Hegde, Vice-Chancellor, Distinguished Members of the University Authorities and Faculty, Graduates of the Year, Ladies and Gentleman:</em></p>
		<p>I feel greatly honoured to have been invited to deliver the Convocation Address today. The graduates, who are passing out today, are inheritors of the legacy of this great University, which they have to live up and to carry forward. I congratulate you all for reaching an important milestone in your career. I congratulate the proud parents too for seeing the fruition of the dreams and the sacrifices that you made to give your children a bright future. Education is probably the best gift that the parents can give to their children, so that they can build their future, build their tomorrow.</p>
		<p>What will be our tomorrow like? Tomorrow's societies will be knowledge societies. Tomorrow's markets will be knowledge markets. Tomorrow's wars will be fought not by the conventional weapons, guns, missiles and so on, but they will be fought in the knowledge markets with the new thermonuclear weapons called information and knowledge. The war on a patent right, which took place between Eastman Kodak and Polaroid, was settled for about one billion dollars recently. This is half of India's R &#38; D budget! So these wars in the knowledge market will be quite expensive.</p>
		<p>There are expensive wars in the knowledge market that the Indian industry will have to face, as it integrates its economy with the global economy. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) will be crucial in fighting these wars! Indeed in the world of knowledge-based competition, IPR will emerge as a key strategic tool.</p>
		<p>The issue of patents, in particular, has created a national interest and debate of great dimension. I thought it might be useful to focus on this specific area in this address. A weak physical infrastructure, inadequate intellectual infrastructure, poor public awareness and delays in implementing government policies are hurting India today. We are behind the rest of the world in patents, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Why is this so? The basic criterion for the grant of a patent is that the innovation must have elements of novelty, non-obviousness and utility. How much of the research that we do today meets even some of these basic criteria? Many of the Indian R &#38; D institutions and industrial firms have so far focussed on imitative research or reverse engineering. How do we change our mindset so that we move on to doing truly innovative research or doing forward engineering? This is the first big challenge.</p>
		<p>Skills in filing, reading and exploiting patents will be most crucial in the years to come; but our ability to read or write patents is very poor. Neither can we properly protect our inventions nor can we understand the implications of the patents granted to our competitors. Many of the patents written by our professionals could be easily circumvented. Manpower planning for IPR’ protection needs priority. IPR must be made a compulsory subject matter in the law courses in the Universities in India. Our graduates coming out of engineering and technology streams have no idea about IPR, and yet it is these young people, who will have to fight these emerging wars in the knowledge markets. A number of patent training institutes will have to be set up. China has already set up 5,000 patent training institutes! Judicious management of patent information will require well-structured functioning of information creating centres, information documenters and retrievers, information users, IPR specialists and information technology experts. A major effort on incorporating strong systems on generation of IPR, its capture, documentation, valuation, protection and exploitation will need a massive thrust.</p>
		<p>Before we protect IP, we must generate IP, which is worth protecting. Our institutions, national laboratories and industrial R &#38;#38; D laboratories will have to gear up for this. Nurturing a strong innovation been through a balanced system of recognition and rewards is the need of the hour. We will have to invest liberally to enhance the skills and knowledge base of scientists, through structured in-house and external professional training programmes, some even abroad, on understanding, interpreting and analysing the techno-legal and business information contained in IP documents, and in drafting of IP documents. For this we need to avail the services of high-class national and foreign consultants and attorneys. We need to encourage the publication ofR &#38; D results in scientific papers only after careful consideration of the consequences on IP rights. It is hard to estimate the loss of Indian intellectual property due to the inadvertent publication of usable knowledge in the last few decades. Monitoring national and international patents and other IP through access to on-line databases, to ensure effective protection and to ward off infringements and threats to India's IP portfolio will be crucial. Analysing and assessing techno-legal ana business information and market intelligence to identify strategic alliances and to exploit potential uncovered <em>niche</em> areas of opportunities itself will give rise to new knowledge-based business.</p>
		<p>Further, we need an intellectual property policy that is dynamic and not static. We can illustrate this with an example. For instance, there are several areas of conflict and debate in the existing patenting system. One issue is that of public vs. private knowledge. Some types of knowledge – for example. educational technologies, life saving technologies, must be available to all, not just to the rich. We need to develop principles by which we determine as to when the knowledge will be publicly available and when it will be kept private. Agencies should be set up to buy knowledge for the public good, including by using those principles used in land acquisition proceedings - but this requires a clear legal and policy framework.</p>
		<p>The present patent system is made applicable to all types of industries, types of inventors and types of knowledge. This cannot work. The electronics industry, where products life cycles are small, wants speed and short term protection. Whereas pharma industry, where profits are earned, after a long time of rigorous evaluation of safety, toxicity etc., wants long term protection. We must realise that one size does not fit all and revisit the patenting system based on the issues of cost, speed of issuance, dispute settlement and so on based on the type of industry, inventor, knowledge, etc.</p>
		<p>The industrial property systems were set up centuries ago for inanimate objects, and that too in formal systems of innovations. A great challenge is now emerging to look at the systems that will deal with animate objects (such as plants and animals) and with informal systems innovation (such as those by grass root innovators like farmers, artisans, tribes, fishermen and so on). The standard intellectual property system will certainly not suit such innovators and their innovations. We need innovation in the intellectual property system itself. Shorter duration patents for smaller innovations, including specific improvements in the traditional knowledge need to be conceived. They will involve simple registration-cum petty patent system where the inventive threshold would be lower but even a small improvement in material, process, product or use could be protected at much lesser costs and for shorter duration. This will give a boost to the creative capabilities of otherwise deprived innovators. We, in India, will have to develop our own models for this.</p>
		<p>The knowledge-based industry in India, such as the IT industry, pharmaceutical industry, etc. will have to face new challenges in the new IPR regime. The IT industry has maintained an impressive growth rate and we have the dream of becoming an IT super-power, raising our software exports from $2 billion to $ 50 billion in the next 10 years. If this has to happen, then we will have to reduce the content of body shopping and move on to innovative IT products, which will need IP protection. The Indian IT industry has so far cared for this, but it will have to play an increasing attention to this aspect.</p>
		<p>The same is the case with our pharma industry. From an importer of even the formulations in early 50s, our pharma industry has become a net exporter. We need to recognise that it will start feeling the heat of the global competition soon. The global pharmaceutical industry is a knowledge industry and the emerging Indian pharma industry will have to be no exception. It has survived so far without developing new molecules. Indeed only fourteen new molecules have been developed o far in the last forty years, out of which eleven have teen from the CSIR system. But with the advent of the new patent regime, the strategies will have to change. I do strongly believe that the Indian Industry can once again rise to the occasion just as it did in the 70- under the provisions of the Indian Patents Act 1970. Indian pharma industry, apart from pursuing novel synthetic routes to known molecules must pursue basic research for patent-worthy inventions comprising new molecules. It will have to forge partnerships with national laboratories in a Team India spirit to surge ahead. As a new strategy, the pharma industry could pursue the development of new molecules upto the point of pre-clinical stage and license these to national and international partners. Some of the enlightened pharma players in the Indian Industry are already beginning to reap the benefits of this strategy.</p>
		<p>I have so far spoken about the factors which will drive knowledge markets dominated by conventional industries as in industrialized societies.. The issues linked to traditional knowledge and biodiversity are far more complex. India, with approximately 8%of world's biodiveristy and as one of the greatest storehouses of traditional knowledge, has the potential of becoming a major player in the global trade in herbs-based formulations, medicines and products. An estimate by the EXIM Bank puts the international market of medicinal plants-related trade at US $ 60 billion per year growing at about 7% annually. India has only 2.5% share of this market.</p>
		<p>Knowledge-rich companies and researchers from the developed world have been attracted to the wealth the poorer countries have in their biodiversity and the traditional knowledge systems. Some argue that the access to such biodiversity and community knowledge by the industrially developed nations is necessary for the larger welfare of mankind as this advances knowledge and leads to new products which contribute to the well-being of global consumers. However, this is not the point. The point is that this access to the resources of the poor does not benefit them in any way, while their natural resource and intellectual property continue to be appropriated and exploited.</p>
		<p>Many researchers who have obtained knowledge about biodiversity and its uses from local innovators, communities and institutions do not even acknowledge their contributions, let alone sharing of the benefits resulting from such knowledge. One recalls here the case of a new antibiotic. This was launched in the USA based on the discovery of peptides in frog skin by a researcher who had found three tribes in Africa and America, which knew about the wound-healing capabilities of the frog skin and were using it for that purpose. However, no benefit was given to the tribes.</p>
		<p>The local communities or individuals do not have the knowledge or the means to safeguard their property in a system, which has its origin in very different cultural values and attitudes. The communities have a storehouse of knowledge about their flora and fauna — their habits, their habitats, their seasonal behaviour and the like—and it is only logical and in consonance with natural justice that they are given a greater say as a matter of right in all matters regarding the study, extraction and commercialisation of the biodiversity. A policy that does not obstruct the advancement of knowledge, and provides for valid and sustainable uses and intellectual property protection with just benefit sharing is what we need. When we come up for reviewing TRIPS, we need to push for TRIPS plus, meaning TRIPS plus equity and ethics.</p>
		<p>It needs to be emphasized that the issues of the economics of community knowledge are truly complex. While it is true that many indigenous cultures appear to develop and transmit knowledge from generation to generation within a system, individuals in local or indigenous communities can distinguish themselves as informal creators or inventors, separate from the community. Furthermore, some indigenous or traditional societies are reported to recognise various types of intellectual property rights over knowledge, which may be held by individuals, families, lineages or communities. Discussion of IPRs and traditional knowledge should draw more on the diversity and creativity of indigenous approaches to IPR issues. In addition, there are power divisions as well as knowledge divisions among people in many communities, and sharing of benefits with a community as a whole is no guarantee that the people who are really conserving traditional knowledge and associated biodiversity will gain the rewards they deserve for their efforts.</p>
		<p>To encourage communities, it is necessary to scout, support, spawn and scale up the green grass root innovation to generate employment and use natural resources sustainably through linking of innovation, enterprise and investment. This requires building up adequate linkages with modem science and technology and market research institutions. In short, one needs new models of development, employment generation and conservation of natural resources.</p>
		<p>There is also a deep philosophical divide on the issue of IPR that we have to deal with. The existing IPR systems are oriented around the concept of private ownership and individual invention. They are at odds with indigenous cultures, which emphasize collective creation and ownership of knowledge. There is a concern that IPR systems encourage the appropriation of traditional knowledge for commercial use without the fair sharing of benefits, or that they violate indigenous cultural percepts by encouraging the commodification of such knowledge.</p>
		<p>While recognizing the market-based nature of IPRs, other non-market-based rights could be useful in developing models for a right to protect traditional knowledge, innovations and practices. Geographical indications and trademarks, or sui generis analogies, could be alternative tools for indigenous and local communities seeking to gain economic benefits form their traditional knowledge. To date, debate on IPRs and biodiversity has focused on patents and plant breeders' rights. The potential value of geographical indications and trademarks needs to be examined too. They protect and reward traditions while allowing evolution. They emphasise the relationships between human cultures and their local land and environment. They are not freely transferable from one owner to another. They can be maintained as long as the collective tradition is maintained. Finally, different interest groups, such as industry, intellectual property experts, and indigenous and local peoples' organizations need to cooperate in order of define mechanisms for more effective sharing of benefits with the providers of traditional knowledge and genetic resources.</p>
		<p>Finally, I believe that we will have to mobilize public opinion and influence government decisions and policies on diverse IP issues. This should be done, not through emotional cries, but on the basis of analytical and scientific studies taken up in-house or commissioned nationally and internationally. We must spearhead a movement towards formulating a national IP policy. As India moves into the next century, it should be seen as a nation that is leading and not following. Next century is the century of mind and, I am sure, India will not only lead but it will set the mood and tone for others to follow.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">EIGHTIETH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
		<p>By<br /> <strong>PROF. V. C. KULANDAISWAMY</strong><br /> <em>Former Vice-Chancellor, Anna University, Chennai<br />and<br /> Indira Gandhi National Open University,</em><br />New Delhi</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Wednesday, March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2000﻿</em></p>
		<p><em>Madam Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Distinguished Members of the University Authorities, dear Graduates, Ladies and Gentlemen,</em></p>
		<p>I am thankful to the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and the authorities of the University for the honour they have done, by inviting me to address the Convocation of one of the premier universities in this country- oldest in the South, next to the University of Madras. I certainly feel humble when I look at the galaxy of names of Chief Guests who have preceded me. Mysore again is a city, having behind it a long history and record of patriotism, contributions to art and culture, spiritual heritage and efficient administration. A visit to this city brings to our mind a panorama of the glories of our past.</p>
		<p>A convocation address has traditionally been an occasion when we devote our thought to a subject of significance and importance. Since my career throughout has been in higher education, I deem it appropriate that I share with you, some of my thoughts or concerns on the subject.</p>
		<p>Madam Chancellor, we have virtually become a nation whose past-time seems to be, one of criticising or condemning what has been done, or what is being done, often indulged in by those who, by themselves, have done precious little as their contribution. Among the many sectors, the most severely criticised is higher education. Administrators find fault with it; parents express great dissatisfaction; political leaders, both ‘in position? and ‘in opposition' unusually become united when it comes to condemning higher education. In short, any one who passes by an institution of higher learning, pauses for a moment, picks up a stone, hits at it and leaving it bleeding, walks along with the supreme satisfaction that he/she has made his/her contribution to education. This game has been going on for the last forty years; but it has brought no great change; condemnation is no contribution; words break no bones. Education certainly needs the abiding interest of intellectuals; involvement of employers and the concern of the people's representatives. What we would plead for is co-operation, guidance and where necessary constructive criticism.</p>
		<p>India has one of the largest systems of higher education. It has produced men and women of merit who have done well within the country and have acquitted themselves with exceptional merit all over the world, wherever they happened to serve. We have institutions of education and research that would compare favourably with some of the best in the world. <strong>But, while the peaks dazzle and glitter, the base is weak: the average is poor.</strong>strong> We live in a knowledge society; the future of any nation depends on its ability to generate new knowledge and transform knowledge into wealth. <strong>In this background, the highest of education for a few is as important as basic education for all.</strong></p>
		<p>Science and Technology has emerged as the most dominant force, influencing almost all the fields of human activity and is decisively the tool for economic development. It is against this context that Dr. Abdul Kalam has observed that<strong> we have to arm India with technology if we are to transform it from a developing country into a developed one.</strong></p>
		<p>When I emphasise the importance of Science and Technology in education, it is not as though I ignore the importance of personality development. The NPE 1986 stresses the importance of values. As early as 1882, the Hunter Commission appointed by Lord Ripon suggested that: an attempt should be made to prepare a moral text book based upon the fundamental principles of natural religion, such as may be taught in all government and non-government colleges... The Principal or one of the Professors, in each Government and aided college, deliver to each of the college classes in every session, a series of lectures on the duties of a man and a citizen.</p>
		<p>The main problem in introducing classes on values, is one of deciding the content and finding for teaching the subject, right kind of persons, who by their own living will qualify for the task.<strong> Swamy Vivekananda said that if he was given hundred motivated young men and women, he would reform the whole society. To-day, it may be easy to find hundred motivated young men and women; but it is difficult to find a Swamy Vivekananda.</strong></p>
		<p>In our attempt to keep higher education in good repair, we have had a series of committees and commissions on Education.</p>
		<p>We have produced at least, two major National Policy documents; one in 1968 and the other in 1986. There were two more after 1986.<strong> The NPE 1986 consists of a number of extremely valuable suggestions; but sadly, the reports and policy papers in so far as higher education is concerned, remain as documents often quoted but unimplemented.</strong> The problem is not one of the policies, but of implementation. I may cite one or two examples.</p>
		<p>Higher Education in India is fragmented. We have the UGC; AICTE; MCI; ICAR and NCTE at the national level. They function in parallel and there is hardly any co-ordination. To bring about a co-ordinated effort, the NPE 1986 recommended the establishment of a <strong>National Council for Higher Education;</strong> but it has not been established so far. The problem has been, we learn, one of deciding as to who is to be the chairperson. The thinking seems to have been that the chairperson must be a minister; but there are three ministers heading the concerned departments. No one may agree to be a member of the council under another cabinet colleague as chairperson. The alternative was the PM; but he may not find time and with the Prime Minister as the Chairperson, the Council may not meet at all. It is the way of our bureaucracy that if a problem is complex, it postpones the decision. Consequently, a Council recommended in the National Policy, incorporated in the Programme of Action and approved by the Parliament itself, remains unimplemented for the last fifteen years. A view point is that the Council may be established with the heads of the above five bodies, the Director General, CSIR and the Chairperson of ICSR. The senior most among them may be the Chairperson of the Council.</p>
		<p>Another instance is the State Council for Higher Education. As mentioned earlier, there are a number of bodies like the UGC, AICTE, ICAR, MCI and NCTE to advise the Government of India on policy formulation and decision making in Higher Education. But the situation is very different when it comes to the State Governments. Though the subject of education is in the concurrent list and the Government of India have certain special powers in the field of higher education as well as education and research in S&#38;T, it is substantially the State Government which directly deals with higher education. There are issues and problems in education and research that are unique in each state. Within the framework of national policy, each state has to prepare its plan for higher education and research in terms of numbers, distribution and areas of importance. The State Government has no expert body as such. It has the department of education at the Secretariat and the Directors of the respective departments. They do not constitute a body of educationists or educational experts. In order to provide a competent academic body to guide the State in its educational endeavour, the NPE 86 has stipulated the establishment of a <strong>State Council for Higher Education.</strong> It was the intention that the State Council will, in conformity with the policies of U.GC., support and complement at the state level the functions of U.G.C. and also be the training ground for the development of academic leaders who can take a long term and comprehensive view of educational and research requirements and advise the State Government as well as play a role at the national level. This has not been established except in a few states and even there, not on the lines of the model Act prepared by the U.G.C., barring perhaps Andhra Pradesh. It is my considered opinion that planning for higher education at the state level needs a body of educationists with an insight into the needs of the present and a vision of the future</p>
		<p>Higher education has expanded considerably, but this expansion has not taken place on a planned basis. In 1960-61, the percentage of students opting for science courses was 30%; by 1998-99, it has come down to 19.6%. One would have expected that in Independent India, which has to depend substantially on Science and Technology for development, the percentage of students in sciences would have increased; similarly during the same period the percentage of Agriculture students has decreased from 1.3 to 1.1 and veterinary medicine from 0.5 to 0.3. These developments have not been on the basis of any national plan or state plan of manpower projection. It is necessary that at the national level and at the state level, each 5 year plan has a projection of: the manpower production to be aimed at, atleast on a rough estimate and the number of colleges, universities and research centres to be established. One would assume that this will be the practice; but unfortunately one gets the impression those colleges, even universities are established, based on adhoc and arbitrary decisions taken by political leaders and implemented by administrators without any involvement of academics. After having taken the decision, the institution is entrusted to academics for development and management without adequate funds.</p>
		<p>The foundation for modern education in India during the British regime was laid by Lord Macaulay in the 1830's and  Sir Charles Wood in the 1850's. It was on the basis of Wood's despatch that the first three universities were established and a Department of Education was created in each province. Since then the British Government appointed periodically commissions and committees to examine the status of education in the country.</p>
		<p>The Wood's despatch of 1854 explicity stated that the instruction in secondary school should be <strong>'practically useful to the people of India in their different spheres of life' and the schools should provide more opportunities than now exist for the acquisition of such an improved education as will make those who possess it, more useful members of society in every condition of life'</strong>. What have been contemplated is opportunities for vocational education at the secondary stage.</p>
		<p>Attempts have been made since the Wood's despatch for over hundred years to give effect to this recommendation, but only with partial and almost insignificant success. We continue to produce more graduates than skilled craftsmen and technicians; more doctors than nurses in this country. As per IAMR Annual Report, 1995, we have (1993) in Modern Medicine and Dentistry 3.3 lakhs of Doctors while the Nurses (1995) are 2.2. lakhs. As per Dr. A. L. Mudaliar Committee Report made nearly forty years ago, the Doctor, Nurse ratio must be 1:3. We are nowhere near achieving it even now. It is difficult to believe that we can produce doctors but not adequate nurses.</p>
		<p>The difference between the advanced countries and developing countries is the difference in productivity. If we take India, the labour force in the organised sector is less than 10%; we have more than 90% in the unorganised sector. Now, who constitute the labour in the unorganised sector? To find an answer we must take a look at our schools.</p>
		<p>In our schools, 34.5% of the students drop out at 5th standard level; 51.6% at 8th standard level. These boys and girls as well as the dropouts at 10th standard enter the unorganised sector, almost without any training in skill. Those who receive vocational training after VIII+ and X+ are very few. The exact number of I.T.I. and polytechnic level Institutions in agriculture, commerce and home sciences is not known. It is close to 7000 in engineering and medicine. The number in agriculture, commerce and home sciences may account for another two thousand or more; however, the number of institutions for preparing craftsmen and technician level manpower may be less than 10,000, while we have more than 11000 institutions for producing graduates. This aberration continues for long. It will not be possible for us to augment the creation of wealth substantially and remove poverty unless we improve the productivity in the unorganised sector.</p>
		<p>Kothari Commission in 1966, National Education Policy in 1968 and again National Policy on Education in 1986, have emphasised the importance of vocational education. The Government of India made available substantial financial assistance in the VII plan and continued it in the VIII plan to implement the programme of Vocational Education at +2 stage. I do not want to go into details, but am sorry to say that our efforts have been a failure more because of conceptual errors. Imparting knowledge and skill at the secondary education stage to massive numbers of boys and girls should be given utmost importance by the planners and policy makers.</p>
		<p>Education is an organic entity. It grows changes and develops to suit the demands of the society where it is practiced. It is a dynamic process. Since the submission of the Report by Dr. Radhakrishnan Commission (1949) higher education has expanded enormously; it has been a linear expansion; by and large a case of more of the same except for the introduction of new disciplines to cope with the advances in knowledge. The system it has remained the same. If someone who was a Vice Chancellor in a university in our system in 1950, happened to go into hibernation for the last 50 years, wakes up now and goes to his old university, he will find himself quite at home; the same file; the same tag; the same pad; the same noting and initials; the usual responses; perhaps more delay, more indiscipline; more processions and protests. Our structure has not changed; the authorities of the universities have not undergone any basic reform, we say that communication technology has invaded all areas of activities, but it has not entered the class room. There, it is the same black board, the same chalk, the same brush and the teacher writes or draws on the board, what is already available in the book, The slides, the overhead projector, the videos and CDROM are reserved for the conferences. The students still do not use text books to study; they depend on bazaar notes or keys that open the doors to examination success. In the alternative, they depend on notes taken down in the class room. It is said that taking down notes started with the students of Aristotle. It is no great credit to our teachers that their students depend for knowledge entirely on a practice initiated in the pre-Christianera.</p>
		<p>As early as 1903, the Government headed by Lord Curzon introduced a Bill in the imperial Legislative Council and Lord Curzon himself stated one of the underlying principles of reform to be: to show the way by which our universities which are now merely examining Boards can ultimately be converted into teaching institutions.</p>
		<p>In so saying he meant research also because the Bill sought to <strong>enlarge the scope of the universities and make it their duty to promote advanced study and research'</strong> and this he said when India and the states had only 192 colleges. It was his wish even then that India should give up the affiliating system; it was referred to, then as “servile adherence to the British model which Britain has given up. This system is antediluvian, anachronistic and does not exist anywhere in the world excepting the Indian subcontinent. It has condemned the teachers to function as mere tutors, transformed the universities into examining bodies and totally vitiated the academic atmosphere.</p>
		<p>All over the world, a semester is the duration of an academic session; but we cling to academic year; Credit is the measure for learning requirement fulfilled and grading on five or ten point scale for the quality of performance; but we still use subject grouping and marking on hundred point scale. Academic autonomy was suggested to relieve the universities of the burden of examinations but out of 11000 colleges, hardly 120 have been granted autonomy. In short, we are where we were 50 years ago or the position is worse. The system is crumbling and groaning under the weight of obsolete practices. Strange to say, the system has successfully resisted all efforts to modernise and bring changes for the better. With these fossilized practices, we cannot find a level field with the rest of the world. We must, without further procrastination implement the recommendations concerning deemed university status for promising institutions, autonomy for colleges, continuous internal evaluation, semester pattern and credit system.</p>
		<p>We are aware the globalisation is an inexorable process and none can escape its effects. We have ourselves opted for liberalisation; whatever the safe guards we may seek, we have to be competitive in the world market in terms of quality of products and competence of manpower. In the words of Dr. Abdul Kalam, if we are to fight poverty and become a developed nation we have to arm ourselves, as already stated, with technology. To-day 50 ► of our technology is imported; another 45% is imported and adapted and only 5% is indigenous. With this level of innovation, we cannot compete with the world; no country will let us buy or borrow upto-date technology. We need to step up our research in S&#38;T. The universities have been the birth place of research. They alone have the benefit of a perennial flow of fresh minds. We must ensure that every institute of higher learning is transformed into a change agent, a resource centre and a place for active research. We need not think that I.I.Sc. level insitutions alone can undertake research. Problems that need solution constitute a spectrum from the simplest at one <em>end</em> to the complicated at the other. For India, the Boeing is important; the bullock cart is also important from the humblest of institutions to centres of excellence, all must be involved in research; all can be involved in research.</p>
		<p>It is necessary that the performance of au-tonomous bodies like the U.G.C. and the universities are reviewed by a competent body of professionals once in five years. The report with the follow up action taken may be placed before the parliament/ assembly. Some argue that this will be an encroachment on the autonomy of the Institutions. Such a view is based on a misunderstanding of the concept of autonomy. Autonomy does not mean freedom from accountability. It only means the freedom to function without interference within the frame work of its statutes and ordinances to achieve its objectives. It is said that a watchful society must bring minor revolutions every now and then to avert major revolutions. If we avoid minor revolutions, we will have to, inevitably, face a major revolution. I may inform in all sincerity that if we, academics, do not bring about reform from within, it will be imposed on us from without. Far reaching reforms in higher education were introduced in well estab-lished democratic countries like Great Britain and Australia by the Governments concerned. The re-lentless march of a society towards a better state could be temporarily halted by an intransigent few: but could not be stopped even by the mightiest of forces. The earlier we perceive the inevitable, the better.</p> 
		<p>In conclusion, addressing myself to the new graduates I may say that you are among the privileged members of the society. With over 230 universities and 11,000 colleges, only 6% of your age group enters the portals of an institute of higher learning. You are one among them. Whatever the problem of unemployment, the country is on a development path and education opens the gates to opportunities. At no time in the history of humanity did knowledge enjoy such economic power as to-day. You have in yourselves the tool to mould your future; a tool provided by the society repre-sented by the common man. He is humble and poor; had no benefit of higher education. His children may not be one among you: but he is your benefactor: Your patron. To him you are Indebted. Wherever you may be and whatever your position, it is only proper to remember that he has placed in us his hopes for the future.</p>
		<p>I wish you all a pioneering career, hard work and great success.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">EIGHTY-FIRST CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
		<p>By<br /><strong> DR. HARI GAUTAM</strong> Chairman, University Grants Commission,<br />New Delhi</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Friday, January 5<sup>th</sup>, 2001﻿</em></p>
		<p><em>Your Excellency Smt. V.S. Rama Devi, Governor of Karnataka and Hon'ble Chancellor of University of Mysore, Dr. G. Parameshwara, Hon'ble Minister of Higher Education, Government of Karnataka, Prof. S.N. Hegde, Hon'ble ViceChancellor, Esteemed members of the Senate and Syndicate, Deans, Faculty members, Intellectuals, Academia, invited guests, persons from media and dear graduates of this University.</em></p>
		<p>I am indeed grateful to you to have invited me as the Chief Guest at this august function. I consider it both as my privilege and honour to address the graduates, the students and others, who have assembled here today to celebrate the 81st Convocation of University of Mysore-a premiere institution of higher education established in 1916 as the fifth university in the country and first in the State of Karnataka.</p>
		<p>Having produced great sons of India like Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Sardar K.M. Panickker and others, the University of Mysore has a rare distinction of having had galaxy of eminent personalities like Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherji, Dr. Annie Besant, Sir Ashutosh Mukherji, Pt. H.N. Kunjru, Dr. Zakir Hussain, Dr. Kasturi Rangan and Justice A.M. Ahmadi as the chief guest to deliver the convocation address. Being conscious of my compared stature, I hope you would not measure me and my address on the same scale as that of these great men.</p>
		<p>Convocations are important events in the life of a University and its graduates. The Convocations give us a sense of identity, continuity across years and reaffirm the duty of each generation to transmit best of its knowledge, wisdom and culture to the next ones. Besides, it provides an opportunity to the graduates to ceremonially receive their degrees and merit credentials.</p>
		<p>Icongratulate the students having received their degrees, medals and academic prizes, it is a landmark event both for you and the University as now after you shall also be the distinguished alumni of this great institution. Young friends, this is an important day in your life as before you now lie a challenge and responsibility to shape your career and future prospects both in Education and also in world at large. Today, you are standing on a bridge between the past and the future. Your education does not end with the degree. Knowledge is not the subjects you have studied. Education is not the total marks and merit positions/awards you have obtained.</p>
		<p>Education is a life time process. Graduation is not the end but a milestone in your journey of learning. You have to keep learning in order to remain upto date in knowledge in the modem society. I may inform you that higher education has a beginning, but no end. A new chapter is now to begin in your life.</p>
		<p>I wish you all the best and pray God for success in shaping your future career. Remember that whatever you do and wherever you are-you shall always be an Indian and more so an alumnus of University of Mysore. Your doings and deeds shall bring credit both to motherland and your mother institution. Plan your career with care and caution. Nothing is impossible to achieve. Learn to use the word “impossible” with greatest caution. May God be with you.</p>
		<p>You would now be spread in many directions. One thing shall be common and be always with you - that is the sense of responsibility this Institution has planted in you. After decades of your working career, you would still remember the period you have spent in this University and you may look back at these golden years as the ones most important in your life.</p>
		<p>Rightly it is said that good students make good University. It would not be an exaggeration if I say that good students are an even better assurance for a high quality University than good Professors. You, belonging to this category, have positively contributed to the pace and progress of this Institution. Your generation, I hope will transform, the future even more profoundly than what the elder generation has been able to achieve. As youth of today you are faced with tremendous challenges which are quite different in nature as compared to those of the past. The world is on the upswing and you ought to be destined to play your due part in shaping the India's future. It is you, my dear young graduates, who will decide the destiny of this country and Its one billion population.</p>
		<p>India, in the last 50 years, has developed a very large system of education and has created a vast body of highly skilled academic people equipped with scientific and technological capabilities, robust humanist, philosophical and thought creativity. India is the largest democracy in the World and I will not be wrong to say that we have the largest educational system as well. The modern higher education system is only 143 years old. It was in 1857, when the first three Universities-- Calcutta, Madras and Bombay - were set up under the British rule. Today we have 256 Universities and 11,831 Colleges.</p>
		<p>Though large, our educational system is neither quite relevant nor very effective. India's educational ethos needs major reforms in the context of changes that are sweeping our country. Transformation that society is going through warrants a rejuvenation in the way we teach and what we teach. Restructuring of our educational institutions and the contents of the curricula is what is needed to produce the desired outcome. Unplanned institutional proliferation and unabated expansion of students' enrolment should be resolutely and effectively curbed. It is, however, more important and pertinent as well to safeguard against mistakes than to unnecessarily expand.</p>
		<p>Decisive and effective measures have to be taken to curb the inferior quality education. India cannot afford to have the graduates, may it be in professional fields or otherwise, who lack the desired competence, talent and degree of information knowledge. A re-look has to be enforced and review of all the institutions may have to be done with the prime objective in mind that only those who deserve to exist are allowed and those which do not should be closed forthwith.</p>
		<p>Recently, mushroom degrees with all kinds of nomenclature are being awarded by the Universities. Same subject degrees are being given with different names ignoring that certain element of uniformity has to be enforced in this respect. The University Grants Commission through section 22 of UGC Act has been empowered to recognise to specify and notify under the approval of Government of India the precise nomenclature of degrees, which can be awarded by the Indian Universities. Any degree not specified/notified by the UGC is an unrecognised degree, hence shall not carry any value whatsoever. All the Universities have been appraised in this respect and been asked to submit details of the degrees they have been awarding and the ones they would like to in future including those in the emerging areas for necessary approval and notification by the UGC.</p>
		<p>Having Hundreds and thousands of Universities and Colleges, we have to have a system to know 'who is who' and what is being done by whom. This not only will encourage competitive spirit among the institutions to perform better but shall also let the people at large know the quality of educational institutions existing at any given time in India. UGC has made it mandatory that all the universities must get them accredited/ assessed by NAAC and the expenses incurred in their accreditation exercise shall be borne by the UGC. This has led to more universities and colleges to seek the accreditation.</p>
		<p>The question of encouraging private initiative in higher education needs to be taken more seriously. The time has come to make serious efforts to fully harness the human and material resources of civil society. The main purpose of this is to bridge the increasing gap between good opportunities available for higher studies and those required to meet the growing demand. Self--financing Universities and Institutions of excellence should be encouraged.</p>
		<p>The University Grants Commission has now empowered the universities to operate multi campuses in the country and even open foreign campuses. This shall allow the institution of commitment and excellence to operate anywhere in India and also abroad. Effective and efficient export of good quality Indian education should now be possible through these foreign centres.</p>
		<p>Through a recently taken historic decision, to encourage the opening of self financing of institutions of excellence, the University Grants Commission henceforth, shall confer a ‘provisional status of deemed university on new de novo institutions in emerging areas with promise of excellence not yet fully complying with the other prescribed UGC guidelines. Such a provisional status of deemed to be university shall be subject to its confirmation after five years on the basis of performance report of the UGC review committee done annually for a five year period.</p>
		<p>It has now been decided that no institution can pre-fix word 'Indian' or 'National as this is exclusively reserved for the institutions established by the Government of India. As per communication of Government of India M/HRD dated September 28, 1999, pre-fixing of the word (Indian Institute) is to be exclusively reserved for institutions established by the Central Government that prefixing the word Indian Institute by any institution established by private body or otherwise does not merit to be given any official recognition or permitted to get such names registered and that the institutions established and maintained by the State Governments be called as State Institute of ... and not the Indian Institute. This shall deter misuse of these words by unauthorized institutions. This is another step to enforce the quality in higher education.</p>
		<p>The University Grants Commission has been given the primary mandate to monitor and maintain the standard of teaching, examination and research. Unfortunately we have not been able to accomplish much as desired in this respect inspite of serious, sincere and sustained efforts been made for years together in this context. The University Grants Commission in consultation with the concerned authorities should enforce the academic audit in the universities to monitor its performance and the academic standard. The University Grants Commission shall now conduct the academic/ financial/administrative audit exercises periodically in the universities and colleges to enforce a better and a disciplined education.</p>
		<p>The University Grants Commission has created 15% supernumerary seats exclusively meant for the foreign students in possession of foreign passports in all the University departments/ subject courses whether technical/professional or otherwise provided that adequate infrastructural facilities are made available in the department/subject concerned. - This shall be available both in undergraduate and postgraduate courses with the rider that under no circumstances a seat remaining unfilled shall be allocated to anyone else than the student possessing foreign passport. However, preference is to be given to persons of Indian origin holding foreign passports. This shall not only give opportunity to a large number of foreign students to take up the Indian education but also supplement financial resources of the universities.</p>
		<p>The UGC has also decided to get the curriculum of all the universities updated to include what is relevant and needed to keep pace with fast development occurring in the respective fields. Exercise to produce a model curriculum in each subject by the eminent experts is already in progress. The University Grants Commission shall ensure that before the beginning of the next session of 2001 all the universities would have updated their curriculum either by adopting UGC model curriculum or a further improved/amended updated curriculum as per decision of their academic councils. Time bound efforts are also being made to update the curriculum and also to introduce on large-scale 'information technology' in graduate education.</p>
		<p>As experience widely goes the quality of research in our Universities, especially the one leading to Ph.D. degree(s), has tremendously suffered during the last decade or so. Whereas those in the South are still better.Universities in.UP, Bihar, Haryana and Rajasthan are particularly afflicted with all sorts of unacademic and unethical practices in the process of award of doctoral degrees. It has indeed become a matter of serious concern, calling for immediate steps to arrest the downward trend. The University Grants Commission has this on priority agenda and shall shortly introduce reforms in the guidelines and rules governing the procedures leading to the research degree of Ph.D. Realizing this too well and to measure a uniform standard of the knowledge, the UGC has recently made it mandatory that the NET qualification shall now be the eligibility for the post of lecturer in the universities and colleges.</p>
		<p>Inspite of the phenomenal growth in the field of higher education there is now a general feeling that the standard of higher education is declining. There is an increasing air of indiscipline and irreverence leading to an increasing sense of disenchantment with the universities and their ability to contribute to the development of science and technology. Erosion of ethical values and moral standard among the teachers, students and society as a whole has undermined the standard of university education. Idealism is a value of the past. Work-culture in research and teaching has been damaged beyond repair in most if not in all the Institutions. It is said that besides the good teachers, we also have the categories of -non teacher, political teacher, a business teacher and an administrative teacher.</p>
		<p>Teacher-taught relationship has not remained pious. Merit has been consistently ignored in most of the Institutions. Nonrecognition of talent, receding professionalism, entry of nonserious students in the institutions, declining reading habits and able to get good scores from the backdoor ways have also been the factors to reckon with. Ingress of politics in academics at the time of appointments and promotions, internal examination system, inbreeding and growing in-discipline has been other areas of grave concern.</p>
		<p>Teaching has a unique dimension of responsibility and commitment. It is important that the quality and merit be not compromised in the process of selection of the faculty positions. Taking it seriously, the University Grants Commission has started observing selection process with an objective to ensure that procedural guidelines, rules and regulations are being duly complied with particularly in the process of promotion from Reader to Professor under the Career Advancement Scheme. Details in this respect have been communicated to all the Universities.</p>
		<p>Freedom cannot be interpreted as the liberty to do anything whatsoever. Nor can autonomy mean the liberty to create anything uncalled for and to create financial requirements without making any serious attempts at raising internal resources. Accountability must remain an essential component of the so-called autonomy pursued in the autonomous institution including that in our university system.</p>
		<p>Recently, there have been certain outcries about the erosion of university autonomy. Every person associated with university system including Vice Chancellor, teachers, non-teaching staff members and students are responsible for this erosion. The main reason is that autonomy has been interpreted in terms of autocracy by most of these members whenever they are in a decision making position but at the same time not willing to take the responsibility to their wrong doings. It is the Vice Chancellor who is responsible for the rise and fall of the university. There is a dire need to provide Vice Chancellors of merit, vision and devotion. It is necessary to see that a person having academic, intellectual and administrative credentials should be dedicated and conscientious functionary who places interest of the institution above everything else. Universities ought to be careful and accountable in their administrative, academic and financial functioning. Autonomy cannot be considered an eternal immutable and un-challengeble right.</p>
		<p>The Universities may have to develop an attitude by which students will be treated as clients with continuously changing needs and ambitions. Teachers and scientists may have to work more to satisfy the wishes of the students and society than their own personal and individual urges and impulses.</p>
		<p>Various Commissions and Committees set up by UGC from time to time have emphasized the need for improving the quality of higher education. For this, the Government has revised the pay scales and service conditions of teachers and created facilities for the professional and career development of the teaching personnel. Unfortunately, an analysis of the status of implementation of the recommendations made by UGC's Expert Committees on the matter, particularly with reference to the number of teaching days, performance evaluation of teachers, etc. does not indicate that we have reached anywhere near the desired goal of making the system of higher education highly quality-oriented, dynamic and socially relevant. The efforts made by the teaching profession, as a whole, for achieving the desired objectives, however, cannot be underplayed. These efforts need to be further intensified particularly in the present context when the intelligentsia and the public at large feel that much is still desired in improving the quality and standards of teaching and research.</p>
		<p>The Government and the UGC have been urging the universities to take appropriate steps for enforcing UGC Regulations and Guidelines for providing quality education. However, nothing substantial seems to have been done by many of the Higher Education institutions in this regard. This matter was discussed at length in “UGC-VCs Session” of All India Vice Chancellors' Conference recently held at Guwahati wherein it was unanimously decided that appropriate action must be initiated by the UGC against the erring institutions. The UGC has now taken it very seriously and proposes to enforce punitive measures against universities/colleges who fail to abide by the prescribed guidelines determining the quality education.</p>
		<p>National Commission Disputes Redressal Commission in its landmark judgment on September 29, 2000, has ruled that imparting education by an educational institution 'for consideration' falls within the ambit of services” as defined in Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It has been held that the relationship between the student and the Institute imparting or offering education is that of provider of service and recipient. The consumer courts have now the jurisdiction to take cognizance of consumer complaints by the students against the educational institutions. This calls for greater accountability on the system, on the institution and the persons who man it.</p>
		<p>There is a growing concern about the decline in the standards both in teaching and research in basic and applied sciences in the university system. We have failed to attract adequate number of talented students and scholars in this area and unless we succeed in creating a strong resource material at the level of basic sciences, it is felt that the benefits from more applied faculties may not be coming through.</p>
		<p>The Commission has decided to create the 'National Lectureship’ in science subjects to start with in certain Universities to provide incentives for the students of commitment and dedication to take up the science research and science education as their career. The National Lectureship’ shall be awarded to the suitable candidates from among those who shall stand 1st class first in M.Sc. in science subjects in all the Indian Universities. The University Grants Commission has also decided to create “Adjunct Professorship”-a designation which may be awarded to any suitable person in industry /research/establishments and other institutions relevant to the subject science courses including research in different universities. The creation and the award of the Adjunct Professorship by the concerned University shall encourage and promote greater interaction both in scientific and technical areas between universities, industries/research and other centres of repute.</p>
		<p>While delivering the Convocation address at Shri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning (Deemed University), Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi, Hon'ble Minister of Human Resource Development and Science and Technology has said: “We all know that the repository of knowledge from Vedas to present time is in Sanskrit and therefore, Sanskrit should be studied compulsorily in all our learned Institutions. As I study the ancient texts I feel amazed at their profundity- be philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, architecture, engineering and even modern social sciences like economics, sociology, jurisprudence etc.”</p>
		<p>Indian Science today unfortunately is very westernized because the scientific knowledge taught in the universities lacks a connection with the spiritual, and never mentions India's ancient tradition of scientific inquiry. Major discoveries in Indian science such as position of the stars, the calculation of solar eclipses or the concept of the zero were made at the time when there were no instruments. Egyptians built their pyramids by means of Indian Arithmetic. 18th Century French Astronomers were using Hindu calculations for the positions of the stars and solar eclipses. Genius like Ramanujan without sophisticated means was able to devise stupendous mathematical theorems. Modern scientific and technological accomplishes find mention in our ancient texts which at one time seemed a figment of imagination and storytelling.</p>
		<p>The UGC has taken a lead of encouraging Sanskrit to be learned not only as our heritage language but also for providing a window to seek information about the vast treasures in science and other subjects stored in Sanskrit. The UGC has instituted ‘National Sanskrit award' for a. university / college teacher for excellence in teaching, contribution and propagating interest of Sanskrit in the field of higher education. This annual award is of Rs. 1 lakh and carries a ceremonial citation. The UGC has also decided to open “simple Sanskrit speaking centres” like those already existing for Yoga in the universities. This shall provide opportunity for students of any discipline to learn speaking Sanskrit and shall also prompt them to know more of this language.</p>
		<p>Information and technology explosion during the last two decades and establishment of the vast cyber space network cutting across the developed and developing nations are going to create an impact of an unknown magnitude the world has never imagined before. Perhaps the most profound and exciting opportunity for the application of IT is in the field of higher education. There is thus an urgent need to formulate and immediately implement the much-desired fundamental reforms in the higher education. The University Grants Commission though already introduced LT courses has now decided to launch this on a larger scale.</p>
		<p>Education is and will continue to be the most important determinant of India's future. The real question is what will be the type, quantity and quality of education delivered to the Indian people during the next two decades. It shall of course play an unprecedented and revolutionary role, The UGC is consciously aware of this commitment and is poised to introduce courses in or related to information technology in university higher education. Our updated curriculum should not ignore the Indian perspectives. Our Research should be oriented to what we actually need taking due notice of the treasure of huge information already available in our ancient texts and practice. We must be able to use and not be used. We should lead and not follow.</p>
		<p>The recent trend of Globalization of Education has made an impact on Indian Education. A large number of the foreign universities have entered in to India and operating through various channels. Their status/stature and modalities of operation are at times questionable. In the interest of the nation, the operation of foreign universities in India may therefore be rationalized and monitored. This needs to be done either through the legislation or through the UGC regulation. The UGC is now seriously considering to formulate a regulation to monitor and rationalise operations of the foreign universities in India.</p>
		<p>Changing times demand a new concept, an innovative approach to reform and update our educational system and to create institutions with more meaningful contact with the society at large. The real question is not whether higher education will be transformed but rather how and by whom. Let us dedicate ourselves to the cause of education and higher education with greater commitment and more dedication.</p>
		<p>We need a leader in education. To lead this movement of reforming the education. We need new leaders who will innovate, who will promote innovation, who will dare, who will set the goals and who will also take risks.</p>
		<p>Swami Vivekananda said that if he was given hundred motivated young men he would reform the whole -Society.</p>
		<p>Today, it may not be difficult to find hundred motivated men but is very difficult to find one Swami Vivekananda.</p>
		<p>Let me part by wishing you all a happy and prosperous new year. Let a new vista open in the new millennium wherein we present to the nation what is expected out of us.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">EIGHTY-SECOND CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
		<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong> PROF. R. NATARAJAN</strong><em> Director, Indian Institute of Technology Madras<br />Chennai - 600 036</em></p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Saturday, December 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2001﻿</em></p>
		<p><em>Vice-Chancellor Professor S.N. Hegde, Distinguished Faculty and Staff Members; Distinguished Invitees, and the Successful Graduates of the University:</em></p>
		<p>At the outset, I would like to express my thanks to Her Excellency the Chancellor of this University and your ViceChancellor for inviting me to deliver the Convocation Address. My Heartiest Congratulations to all of you, New Graduates, on the successful completion of your degree programmes. I wish all of you very prosperous and professionally satisfying careers.</p>
		<p>In my Convocation Address, I would like to explore issues relating to the following five areas, which are of crucial importance to the promotion of higher education:</p>
		<p>1. Strategies for Quality Assurance in Higher Education.</p>
		<p>2. Technology-Enabled Learning Initiatives.</p>
		<p>3. Internationalization of Higher Education.</p>
		<p>4. Resource Mobilization.</p>
		<p>5. The Importance of Collaboration and Networking.</p>
		<p><strong>I. STRATEGIES FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION</strong></p>
		<p><strong>The Evolving Concept</strong></p>
		<p>Historically the concept of Quality has evolved from the manufacturing sector during the past two decades, wherein they were associated with products such as air-conditioners, cars, cellular phones, semiconductors, etc. In those industries, Quality was about minimizing variance and ensuring that the manufactured products conformed to clear specifications. The essence of this concern was that customers could expect the product to perform reliably. This focus on minimizing variability prompted more and more companies to adopt quality control practices, exemplified by: statistical process control, design for manufacturing, and Six Sigma and Taguchi methods for eliminating defects in various stages of design and manufacturing. Currently more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies use a combination of these methods.</p>
		<p>While manufacturing companies focus on controlling product variability, Service businesses have had to develop a more comprehensive view of Quality. They are not only concerned with minimizing defects, but also about managing emotions, expectations and experiences. “Each consumer may have different tolerance levels for things that can go wrong". Service businesses are now adopting the emerging view of quality, adjusting to the dynamically shifting expectations of customers; the focus of quality control has shifted, according to Reichheld and Sasser, from “zero defects” in products to “zero defections” of customers. In the service view of quality, businesses have to recognize that specifications are not just set by a manufacturer who tells the consumer what to expect; instead, consumers also may participate in setting specifications. Varying expectations make it difficult to pin down specifications. As these specifications change, manages must be able to adjust to new quality expectations. That is why it is so important to focus strongly on employee training.</p>
		<p>In software and information products, the concept of Quality usually incorporates both the conformance and service views of quality. On the one hand, there exists a minimal set of features that must always work. On the other hand when customers have problems using a software package, they define quality according to their experience with the technical support centre. As software enters into new functional areas that are less clearly understood by customers, the demand for support services will increase.</p>
		<p>The view of quality in software products has yet another dimension. Software users expect a continuous stream of novel features: the promise of upgrades; high performance and reliability; ease of installation, use and maintenance. In the "cookies” concept in Internet softwares, the company identifies its customers and offers them personalized greetings and information when those customers enter the company's web site. In setting software quality standards, it is important to realize that customers develop new uses for products as novel features are added. Thus, continuous experimentation and the development of new and innovative features play an important role in shaping consumer perceptions of quality in software. In summary, a new view of quality is required to assess an organization's IT infrastructure. The perspective consists of a synthesis of conformance, adaptability and innovation.</p>
		<p><strong>Is Academic Quality Quantifiable?</strong></p>
		<p>There have been several discussions on this fundamental question. It is widely believed that academic quality, like Beauty, for example, is an elusive characteristic. Robert Pirsig has resorted to much verbal gymnastics in coming to terms with Quality:</p>
		<p class="myquote"><em>“Quality you know what it is, yet you don't know what it is. But that is selfcontradictory. But some things are better than others; that is, they have more quality. But when you try to say what the quality is, apart from the things that have it, it all goes poor”.</em></p>
		<p>Quality is a complex, multi-dimensional entity, no doubt; but so are many other things of significance, and we have learned to deal with them; such as, for example, Development, Growth, Excellence, Democracy, Religion.</p>
		<p>Two quotations are given below to bring out the need for quantification, and simultaneously the limitations of this approach:</p>
		<p class="myquote">Lord Kelvin: “Whe<em>n you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; and when you cannot measure it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind”.</em></p>
		<p class="myquote"><em>G.N. Lewis: “I have no patience with attempts to identify Science with measurements, which is but one of its tools, or with any definition which would</em> exclude a Darwin, a Pasteur or a Kekule”.</p>
		<p><strong>Application of Benchmarking to Higher Education:</strong></p>
		<p>In many ways, and without realizing it, colleges and universities have been engaging in benchmarking over the years. They have compared themselves to their peers while aspiring to higher levels of enrollment, funding, recognition and prestige. Higher education has a strong tradition of knowledge-sharing through conferences, meetings, workshops, publications, listservs, etc.</p>
		<p>Modern businesses consider benchmarking to be much more than simply comparing oneself against a statistical norm or standard. Benchmarking involves first examining and understanding one's own internal work procedures, then searching for best practices in other organisations that match the identified ones, and finally, adapting those practices within the organization to improve performance. In essence, it is a systematic way of learning from others and changing what is currently done. In successful companies, it is found that benchmarking is fully integrated into the organizational strategy, structure and culture. It is usually only one of several quality tools, with others like Continuous Quality Improvement (CRI), Re-engineering, and Baldrige assessments, also being deployed within a broader view of change management and organizational transformation.</p>
		<p>In contrast, the type of benchmarking, or knowledgesharing, that has taken place in higher education, is mostly the result of friendly rivalry among peers. True benchmarking encourages us to look beyond our peers for processes that are similar, and implemented better, in different types of organisations. Classic examples of this type of cross-industry benchmarking include: Southwest Airlines learning from the pit crew of an Indianapolis 500 race car team; and the staff of hospital emergency room learning from Domino's Pizza on how to take pertinent customer information from the telephone quickly. Higher education institutions have typically maintained that they have little to learn from other higher education institutions not like themselves, let alone from organizations outside the academe.</p>
		<p>The reason why higher education institutions should care about benchmarking is: competition, from traditional rivals as well as new rivals, such as corporate universities, virtual universities, open universities, distance learning providers, etc. While higher education of the traditional kind may be described as “mature”, the breathtaking advances in technology, combined with changing demographics, give it the characteristics of an “emerging" or "growth” sector. One of the essential characteristics of an emerging sector is that there are no game rules. The competitive landscape in this sector comprises technological uncertainty, start-up companies and spin-offs, absence of clear product or technical standards, customer confusion, erratic product quality, and regulatory constraints.</p>
		<p>A small number of institutions committed themselves to full-scale benchmarking in the mid-1990s. In 1992, the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) initiated a “benchmarking survey", which eventually covered 600 different benchmarks over a wide range of administrative functions and processes. This study focused on defining the benchmarks themselves, which enable institutions to identify gaps in performance. In corporate circles, a more concerted and disciplined effort is made to identify the processes behind the benchmarks that actually lead to improved performance.</p>
		<p><strong>The Significance of ISO-9000 Certification:</strong></p>
		<p>Over the past 10 years, several companies in India have secured ISO-9000 certification, mainly to fulfill the quality requirements of foreign customers. Recently, a few technical education institutions have also obtained ISO-9000 certification: IIT-Madras is one of the first higher technological institutions to secure ISO-9001, for six units- Central Library, Central Workshops, Centre for Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research, User-oriented Programme in construction Technology and management, Academic Section, and computer Centre. The rationale for seeking to obtain ISO-9000 was that there are many activities in a technical education institution which closely resemble those in a manufacturing or service organization, and are amenable to ISO-9000 certification.</p>
		<p>It is instructive to review the major features of ISO-9000 Certification system. ISO-9000 is a set of written standards laying down a quality systems. It defines the basic elements of the system through documentation. It creates a quality system rooted in the customers' requirements, and ensures uniform systems that are universally recognized. It creates the discipline required for a total quality process.</p>
		<p>ISO-9000 is not TQM (Total Quality Management) for the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ISO-9000 is based on standards and ignores the human element.</li>
			<li>ISO-9000 lays down only systems; it says nothing about implementation</li>
			<li>ISO-9000 certification is unsustainable and prone to the day-after effect.</li>
			<li>ISO-9000 makes no demands on or assurances about final product quality.</li>
			<li>ISO-9000 transfers the onus of ensuring quality to the certifier.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>ISO-9000 especially helps: those companies that market their products in the European Community; vendors supplying to companies that demand ISO-9000 certification, companies whose competitors are certified or are seeking ISO-9000 certification, companies with geographically-scattered facilities and global operations; and companies whose trans-national parents are seeking ISO-9000 certification.</p>
		<p>ISO-9000 doesn't help: companies whose CEOs see ISO-9000 certification as an end in itself; companies that have a quality system in place or are implementing TQM; companies following other widely-accepted quality systems, companies whose quality problems stem primarily from HRD problems; and companies that are struggling for survival in today's marketplace.</p>
		<p>ISO-9000 standards complement TQM's emphasis on the human element. It helps in the assessment of the company's quality requirements. It translates quality concepts into achievable targets. It provides an opportunity to create and improve quality systems. ISO-9000 helps spread the message of quality across the organisation. The Accreditation Initiatives of NBA:</p>
		<p>Following the conferment of statutory status to the AICTE in 1988, the NBA (National Board of Accreditation) was established in September 1994, with the mandate to periodically conduct evaluation of technical institutions or programmes on the basis of guidelines, norms and standards specified by it and to make recommendations to it, or to the Council, or to the Commission or to other bodies, regarding recognition or derecognition of the institution or the programme.</p>
		<p>The NBA is charged with the task of evolving a procedure for quality assessment in the Technical Education sector, and specifically to</p>
		<ul>
			<li>articulate the criteria for assessment of quality</li>
			<li>identify parameters to quantitatively assess these criteria and assign appropriate programme-specific weightages for each</li>
			<li>validate the procedure by well-designed test runs</li>
			<li>establish appropriate benchmarks.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The major policy adopted by the NBA is to accord accreditation not to the Institution as a whole, but at the  programme level, viz., and the 4-year degree course after 10+2, and the 3-semester ME/M.Tech programme after the bachelor's degree. Furthermore, the programmes are graded into categories A, B, C and NA, depending on the rating they achieve on a 1000-point scale. This is especially significant for promoting healthy competition for quality among the different degree programmes of the same institution, as well as among similar programmes in different institutions. Thus, in a given institution, some degree programmes may be accredited with high grades, while some weak programmes are rated low, or even denied accreditation</p>
		<p>The overwhelming aim and objective of accreditation is to recognize and acknowledge the value-addition in transforming the admitted student into a capable and competent engineer, having sound knowledge of fundamentals and an acceptable level of professional and personal competence for ready employability in responsible engineering assignments.</p>
		<p><strong>II. TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED LEARNING INITIATIVES</strong></p>
		<p>There are at least two ways in which Technology provides inputs to Technical Education:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The accumulated Knowledge and Experience of the various shades and forms of Technology add to the content of the Technical Education, which needs to be transmitted to contemporary students.</li>
			<li>Technical Education, like all Education, is about Teaching and Learning, and there are several Technologies which can improve the effectiveness of the Teaching-Learning processes; e.g. I.T., E.T., etc. While the most explicit impact is through more effective and convenient ways of information delivery, developments are also taking place in content creation, such as authoring systems.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is thus a reciprocal inter-relationship between Technology and Technical Education.</p>
		<p><strong>The Scope of Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL)</strong></p>
		<p>There is considerable hope and some positive evidence that Technology can expand and improve Education at all levels, with special reference to the design and content of instructional materials, delivery, assessment and feedback The term “Educational Technology has been interpreted in two ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Technology in Education</li>
			<li>Technology of Education</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The former is the means, while the latter refers to the core of what the ends should be - learning: how it occurs and how Technology may be deployed to enhance Learning-Technologyenhanced Learning. It is firmly believed by many Educators that the full potential offered by Educational Technology media and devices is yet to be realised.</p>
		<p>In ET and TETE, the role of the Teacher will be expected to be quite different from what it is in traditional classroom teaching. In the latter, the Teacher is the Author, Playwright, Actor and Director, with the Actor's role assuming the major significance; while in the former, he will be more of a Director and a Coach/Facilitator. One of the principal distinctive features of the new ET/TETE systems will be the opportunities provided for individualized, self-paced learning, which caters to the individual abilities and aptitudes of the individual learners, and the possibility of one to one interaction with the teachers. This will also offer better opportunities to provide feedback and permit effective assessment of learning.</p>
		<p>It is interesting to note in this context that the futuristic ABET Criteria 2000 focus more on learning outcomes than on curricular contents and resource availability. It is also necessary to recognize that as is the case with Appropriat Technology, we need Appropriate Educational Technology, for achieving success through strategies which should take into consideration local needs, circumstances and resources.</p>
		<p><strong>Critical Barriers to adequate TEL and WBT use</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>One contributing factor to low-level use of TEL and WBT is that designers, educators, and vendors typically do not associate learning systems with organisational objectives. It is claimed that the implementation of learning and support technologies must integrally be linked to a “compelling” vision and strategic plan. Too often, "individuals concentrate on the latest computer or software package, without linking technology to business objectives or to the core competencies of the organization”.</li>
			<li>Assessors measure Short-term learning, rather than longterm individual and organizational performance, which means training and instructional design work often is inconsistent with business needs. What results is eventdriven training focussed on user acquisition of localized skills, not on the more important cognitive or organizational competencies.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Focus on Fluency rather than Skills</strong></p>
		<p>Discussions on the advanced use of TEL and WBT are concerned with:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>educational theory, research, and practice; and</li>
			<li>industry needs for knowledge workers who are technologysavvy.<br /> In research on the cutting-edge uses of TEL and WBT, useful distinctions are made between first-level learning skills (learning about technology), and second-level skills (learning through technology). Technological fluency associated with second-level learning combines what separately have been called: information, literacy, communication and technology skills. Second-level fluency entails:</li>
			<li>finding information from a variety of sources and disciplinary perspectives.</li>
			<li>making critical judgments about information value, reliability, and validity.</li>
			<li>creating and distributing information and knowledge through many communication</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Spite of the potential to effect great savings from elimination of physical trips by deploying video-and-voice-conferencing services, travel budgets have not decreased. “Displacement of a function by technology can produce net savings in time or money. Dishwashing machines have reduced time spent cleaning dishes at the kitchen sink. In that case, the goal was specific, new technology was able to satisfy it, and in any case, who enjoyed washing dishes? On the other hand, medical care costs have been rising, in spite of progress in technology”. “Historically, education has been more like medical care than like dishwashing. As countries have become wealthier, they have devoted an increasing fraction of GDP to education”. “These increases were driven by the rising wealth of the country and the need to prepare for the more sophisticated jobs generated by the economy”.</p>
		<p>"If every institution, from Podunk Community College to Harvard, uses the same holographic projections of the world's best lectures, and has access to the same digital libraries, how will Harvard differentiate itself', he asks. “The most likely answer is through stress on the quality of its teachers in their other roles. As with business travel, the leveling of technology of a part of the competitive landscape is likely to lead to greater emphasis on the human element, even when the results are hard to measure".</p>
		<p>What will be the future goal of Education, and how do we prepare students for the future? “If education were a simple matter of teaching the three Rs, the future might be different. However, we do not forms that merge in technology-mediated communications formats.</p>
		<p><strong>TEL and the Future of Education</strong></p>
		<p>Andrew Odlyzko of AT &#38; T Labs has explored the role of Technology in shaping the future of Education, and the place of Teacher in this scenario. Education is recognized to be “primarily a process of getting students to absorb new ideas and ways of thinking, and requires extensive social interaction”. Even if future “3-D holographic projections and high-bandwidth networks could make distance learning so effective that live lectures could be phased out”, “teachers would still be employed to provide interactive instruction”. “Technology can replace some teachers in their present roles. Hence, ifall we cared about was to produce what the current system does, we could indeed operate with fewer people. However, we are unlikely to do that. New demands will arise to take up the slack there has always been desire for more personal attention from teachers than could be met”.</p>
		<p>“The main reason for expecting no cutbacks in teacher ranks is that human contact is valued very highly". "When people reminisce about their school days, teachers are mentioned far more frequently than textbooks or buildings. Close human contact appears to improve the perceived quality of instruction, whether that improves test performance or not”.</p>
		<p>On the matter of displacement of current functions by future technology, he points out that in even have a clear idea of what education is supposed to accomplish. “Education is supposed to prepare an individual for life, but we do not have a clear model of how it does that. With rapid change, we do not even know what life to prepare for”.</p>
		<p><strong>III. INTERNATIONALISATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION</strong></p>
		<p>Internationalization has been occupying the attention of national governments, international agencies and institutions of higher education during the past two decades, particularly since the general acceptance of globalization world-wide. There has been an intensification of emphasis by nations and international agencies on international cooperation, collaboration and exchange, and by institutions of higher education on internationalizing Research and Teaching. It is interesting to note that internationalization in higher education has flourished in ancient times as well, with travelling scholars looking for knowledge and an understanding of other cultures.</p>
		<p><strong>The Rationales fin- Internationalization of Higher Education</strong></p>
		<p>The nature and scope of the political and economic rationales for internationalisation of higher education have changed radically through the years. For example, the dominant rationale in the European medieval university, and in the Indian and Arab universities earlier, was social and academic: the wandering scholar looking for knowledge and an understanding of other cultures</p>
		<p>There appear to be four kinds of rationale for institutions of higher education, national governments, international bodies and the private sector, to be actively involved in international educational activities: Academic, social/cultural, political and economic</p>
		<p><strong>Internationalisation as a Measure of Quality</strong></p>
		<p>International competition in higher education has served to include internationalisation as a measure of quality. The Working Group Three of the Network: Higher Engineering Education for Europe, H3E-WG3, is convinced that international orientation is a major measure of the quality of all future engineering education programs. Internationality has come to mean the capability of equipping graduates with competences applicable in a world where national borders no longer hinder the global flow of technologies and products. It is also the ability of the academic communities to attract and integrate intelligence of any nationality seamlessly.</p>
		<p><strong>Internationalisation as a Means of Quality Enhancement</strong></p>
		<p>Many policy documents, for example those of the EU, of national governments, and of universities, have proposed the idea that internationalisation should not be seen as an end in itself, but as a means of quality enhancement. It is increasingly being recognized that the quality of higher education should be assessed at an international level. Higher education institutions are seeking to improve their quality through international networks, consortia and international benchmarking and accreditation exercises. It is believed that international exposure and comparison is the best way to find out about their own performance and to learn from others' experiences.</p>
		<p><strong>IV. RESOURCE MOBILISATION</strong></p>
		<p>While resource management is of primary importance in every sector and at any time, the recent economic policies, reforms and restructuring have necessitated the adoption of innovative strategies in the field of technical education. In general, they are oftwo kinds: optimization of available resources and minimization of costs; and mobilization of additional resources.</p>
		<p><strong>Some Strategies For Resource Management</strong></p>
		<p>There are essentially two strategies for resource management:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>reduce costs</li>
			<li>increase revenue</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It is very important to ensure, however, that in adopting the former the quality of services and operations does not suffer, and in striving for the latter, role distortions do not take place and the principal goals and objectives are not sacrificed.</p>
		<p>Costs can be cut by resorting to power cuts, limiting services such as computers, library, transport, telephones, etc. But it must be ensured that this does not cause deterioration in operational effectiveness and efficiency, especially when the outputs are in an intangible form, as in an educational institution or R &#38; D lab. Bureaucrats and auditors are keen to effect economy, but who is to assess the costs of lost opportunities, delays, etc.?</p>
		<p>In a similar fashion, institutions can promote policies which can bring in visible revenue ; but, when, for example, faculty go after consultancy at the cost of teaching responsibilities, the loss will not appear in the balance sheet, but is quite detrimental to the fulfillment of primary objectives. What is needed is a clear understanding of the roles of a technical institution and its constituent components, and innovative initiatives for resource management, which are compatible with the identified roles.</p>
		<p><strong>Some Strategies for Resource Mobilization</strong></p>
		<p>There is a number of traditional sources of funds for technical institutions: central government, state government, government departments and agencies, research and development agencies and organizations, public and private sector industries. International agencies, alumni, students, etc. The funding from the government sources is drying up in the context of the new economic and industrial policies which call for privatization and a decreasing role for government in higher education, and in the face of increasing demands for funding primary education. Hence, there is a dire need to look for more funding from other sources and innovative strategies for attracting these funds. The technical institutions must not expect dole from the donor organizations, but be prepared to market and offer their strengths to earn the enhanced funding.</p>
		<p>Some of the avenues in this direction are described below:</p>
		<p><em>Funds from industry:</em></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sponsored (full-time and part-time) PG programmes</li>
			<li>Fellowships/Assistantships</li>
			<li>Sponsored research and development projects</li>
			<li>Consultancy-Industrial and Educational</li>
			<li>Institution of Industry Chairs</li>
			<li>Continuing Education Programmes Testing Services</li>
			<li>Equipment</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>Students:</em></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Enhanced Fees (to cover instructional costs).</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>International Sources:</em></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Self-financing students</li>
			<li>Twinning programmes</li>
			<li> R&#38;D projects</li>
			<li> Industrial and Educational Consultancy</li>
			<li> Alumni-donations, Subscriptions to journals, scholarships,etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Some Recent Initiatives at IIT Madras</strong></p>
		<p>With the creation of the Corpus Fund, it has become necessary and advantageous to identify avenues for revenue generation. In principle, one can identify direct and indirect avenues, each covering short-term, medium-term and long-term strategies.</p>
		<p>The direct avenues include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>tuition fee consultancy, sponsored research, technology transfer, software development, continuing education, etc., in the short-term</li>
			<li>research projects, laboratory development, consortium research, etc., in the medium-term.</li>
			<li>technology sales, product development, better campus utilization, work quality improvement, efficient utilization of available facilities, energy conservation, etc., in the long-term.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The indirect avenues include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Endowments, institution of chairs, building funds, etc., mainly from industry.</li>
			<li>Alumni donations.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Some Points of Caution</strong></p>
		<p>While resource generation is important, particularly in the post- 1991 era, the following points of caution are in order, especially in the technical education sector:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Institutions should guard against distortions in the roles of faculty as teacher and consultant; it is more profitable to undertake the latter, in preference to and at the cost of the former. This appears to be a world-wide phenomenon, and not restricted to the engineering profession (cf. medical practice)</li>
			<li>There is a time window for consultancy for activities in every faculty member's career; they should be undertaken after acquisition of knowledge and experience, and peer recognition of competence. It is not consultancy that determines expertise or competence, but R&#38;D.</li>
			<li>Each institution should balance visible outcomes, such as consultancy earnings, with intangible benefits, such as education, research and scholarship.</li>
			<li>It is good to remember that all faculty cannot perform all functions with equal competence; institutions should promote the individual strengths.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The bottom line in all research and consultancy should be quality and relevance.</p>
		<p><strong>V. THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATION AND NETWORKING</strong></p>
		<p>The rationale for collaboration is highlighted by Henry Ford's statement:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>“Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success”.<br />
				Even as the tools and means for tackling problemsscientific, technological, industrial, economic, social-political are becoming powerful and sophisticated, their complexity and scope are also increasing. We need multi-disciplinary approaches, integrated and holistic thinking and collaboration between partners with complementary interests, assets and needs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>What is Collaboration?</strong></p>
			<p>There is a plethora of terms in the literature and common usage to describe “collaboration', often applied indiscriminately, such as, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Partnerships</li>
				<li>Linkages</li>
				<li> Co-sponsorships</li>
				<li> Inter-agency or inter-organizational cooperation.<br />Rebecca Ament identifies five criteria for a relationship to be characterized as collaboration</li>
				<li>Programs or projects are jointly designed and monitored.</li>
				<li>Some autonomy is sacrificed by participants.</li>
				<li>Resources are contributed. Organizations are mutually benefited.</li>
				<li>Administrators are actively involved, or are supportive of the relationship, and maintain final decision-making powers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Benefits of Collaborative Relationships:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Information, ideas and resources can be pooled.</li>
				<li>Duplication and harmful competition can be avoided.</li>
				<li> Partners can provide useful information on needs assessments and program evaluation, suggestion, curricular development, participants, use of facilities and/or stateof-the-art equipment, etc.</li>
				<li>Collaborative relationships expand the capacity of the participants to accomplish objectives that cannot be accomplished as well, alone.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Some Barriers (Inhibitors) for Collaboration</strong></p>
			<p>There are certain barriers/inhibitors for Collaboration which come in the way of realizing the full potential that exists. These represent the impedances against the flux of benefits to the collaborating partners.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>lack of appreciation and understanding of each other's roles, strengths, weaknesses</li>
				<li>lack of communication</li>
				<li>lack of committed individuals on either side</li>
				<li>lack of commitment at the top</li>
				<li>lack of recognition for collaborative work</li>
				<li>lack of institutional and logistical support</li>
				<li>lack of coordination and single-window access.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Some Enabling Features for Promotion of Collaboration and Removal of Barriers</strong></p>
			<p>In order to derive the full benefits of Collaboration, it is necessary to identify and remove the barriers/inhibitors for Collaboration.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Idelintify committed individuals (“champions') on either side, and empower them.</li>
				<li>Enable potential partners to communicate with each other.</li>
				<li>Accord recognition for collaborative work.</li>
				<li> Put in place institutional mechanisms for promoting collaboration.</li>
				<li>Identify collaborative partnership as a strategic intent.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I have attempted to bring to focus a few issues of crucial importance in Higher Education. We are living in a world in which Change is all around us. Only those that recognize it, and respond and adapt to it will succeed. This dynamic Future beckons us with Challenges and Opportunities. The University Education has prepared you to face the challenges and exploit the opportunities. I wish all of you satisfying and interesting professional careers and personal lives.</p>

			<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">EIGHTY-THIRD CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
			<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong>DR. L.M. SINGHVI</strong><br /><em> Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India<br /> Member, Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague<br />Member, Executive Board, UNESCO<br />Chairman, Jnana Pith Pravara Parishad<br /> President, Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts Trust<br /> Chairman, High Level Commission on Indian Diaspora and<br />Organizing Committee, Pravasi Bharatiya Divas<br /> Formerly India's High Commissioner in the U.K.</em></p>
			<p><em>Tuesday, December 31<sup>st</sup>", 2002﻿</em></p>
			<p>I am beholden to my gracious and distinguished friend. His Excellency, the Chancellor and am thankful to the esteemed Pro-Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor and the university authorities for the great privilege of being invited to deliver the Convocation Address at the University of Mysore, a vintage university and a shining early morning star in the firmament of Indian education. In the princely states of Rajasthan before Independence, we looked up to Mysore as a model state. When it was established in 1916, University of Mysore was the first Indian university outside British India and the sixth in the country. Delivering the first Convocation of the University in 1918, the benevolent and enlightened Maharaja of Mysore acknowledged the debt of gratitude he and the people of Mysore owed to the distinguished Dewan of Mysore, Sir M. Visvesvarya and said that it was his patriotism, enthusiasm and unflinching advocacy“which converted what was little more than a dream of the future into a living creation”. Let us begin by paying a homage of reverence and remembrance to that great visionary and pioneer of nationbuilding as well as to the most luminous galaxy of eminent members of the faculty and the alumni who have over the years made the University of Mysore an example of the living legacy of learning and a five star centre of excellence with its precincts and portals echoing the sublime resonance of its logos in Sanskrit sutra "Na hi Jnanena Sadrusham”. That axiom in the words of Vedavyasa speaks of the incomparable primacy of knowledge as a purifier. In a similar vein, Vedavyasa says that knowledge is the incomparable eye. Atharva Veda reminds us that everyone sees with the naked eye but not everyone understands. I pray that Manasagangotri, the name which the campus of Mysore Vishwavidyanilaya bears so meaningfully, may always remain the perennial source of the sacred river of knowledge. Indeed, it is noteworthy that many streams originated from Manasagangotri and thus Mysore university became the mother of four universities namely Bangalore University, Mangalore University, Karnataka State Open University and Kuvempu University. I should mention here en passant, that I had the great privilege of personally knowing the great educationist, author and Rashtra Kavi, Shri Kuvempuji, who served this University with great distinction and whom Jnanapith had the honour of giving the highest literary award of our land. As Chairman of Jnanapith Pravara Mandal, I should also mention on this occasion that Kannada writers have received the largest number of Jnana Pith Awards.</p>
			<p>Jnana and Vidya in the Indian tradition are consecrated to the quest of The Truth (Sathyam), which emancipates, The Good (Shivam), which ennobles, and The Beauty (Sundaram), which enthrals and is a form and source of Bliss. That is why I consider Jnana and Vidya in the Indian tradition as concepts of much wider connotation than those associated with the narrower concepts of knowledge in the common parlance of the west where a distinction is often made between knowledge and wisdom. William Hazlitt thought that the seat of knowledge is in the head; of wisdom in the heart. William Cooper said: “Knowledge is proud that he has learnt so much; wisdom is humble that he knows no more”. Francis Bacon took an unfragmented view of knowledge and said: "I have taken all knowledge to be my province”. The Yogavashistha provides a unifying concept of Jnana and Karma, knowledge and Action by using the metaphor of bird which needs two wings to fly. Indeed, Knowledge is not an island of isolation. It is integral to life which is the true and ultimate encyclopaedia. As my good friend, the great English poetess Kathleen Raine put it:</p>
			<p class="myquote">I've read all the books but one<br /> Only remains Sacred: this<br /> Volume of Wonders, open<br /> Always before my eyes.</p>
			<p>That sacred book, that volume of wonders is Life itself.</p>
			<p>Universities are important because knowledge is important. Universities engage in the systematic quest, compilation and transmission of knowledge. It is knowledge of life and knowledge for life, which together sustain civilizations, ensure their survival and facilitate their progress and prosperity. Knowledge enlightens, emancipates, empowers and transforms. As the British statesman Disraeli put it “It is knowledge that influences and equalizes the social condition of man, that gives to all, however different their political position, passions which are in common, and enjoyments which are universal”. It is knowledge which helps to challenge and change the status quo and the unjust domination of vested interests. Knowledge may create elites but it also broadens democratic transparency and sharpens social, political and economic accountability. Knowledge is power and is potentially the greatest catalyst of change so as to make the weak and the meek more strong and articulate and to make the strong and the articulate more just and fair, more caring and sharing. That is how I see the vision and the mission of the universities throughout the world and more particularly in the so called Third World. That is how universities have to contexualize the quest and application of knowledge beyond Kipling's six honest servingmen whose names are What and Why and When, And Huw and Where and Who. We have to seek and steer knowledge particularly in terms of social relevance and ethical commitment.</p>
			<p>The programmes of Education For All and the fundamental right to education now happily enshrined in Our Constitution will qualitatively strengthen the human resource base of our country and will in the long run impact university education also. I am of the view that vocational education on the widest scale would be the logical next step after universal education for children and adolescents upto the age of 14 lest we should unwittingly add further to the growing ranks of the educated unemployed and to the level of dissatisfaction which can prove to be explosive. Moreover universities cannot afford to permit an indiscriminate intake because that would impair the quality of university education. Good and practical vocational education would ease the pressure on universitįes which must increasingly turn to the task of redesigning and streamlining courses, curricula and pedagogic techniques and methodologies. They must turn to research more pointedly and purposefully.</p>
			<p>The quality of the intake and the excellence of the faculty are the basic determinants of the quality of education and that is an issue which universities of excellence such as Mysore Vishwavidyanilaya have to address. I need hardly add that this university itself provides an example of excellence and an eloquent testimony of the impact of great minds, including a succession of Vice Chancellors and teachers who have won laurels for themselves and for the "Mysore Experiment” which was acclaimed at a conference in Oxford as back far as 1934. I am glad to say that the present Vice Chancellor, Professor S.N. Hegde measures up to the best traditions of creative leadership and academic eminence in the world of education. There is much that this University has already achieved. Its accumulated assets are enormous as the National Assessment and Accreditation Council Peer Team testified in 1999 when it gave five stars to the University and observed:</p>
			<p>"The University of Mysore which has completed eight decades and more is an illustrious example of an institution serving the community in the field of education and contributing to the enhancement of the quality of life of the people. Over the years this has become the Mother University willingly sharing with daughter Universities the responsibility of providing education relevant to the needs of the community. Taking into account the societal needs, scores of career oriented courses have been introduced. The buzzword of modern technology viz., Information Technology is given the rightful place in all disciplines and all out efforts are in evidence to keep ahead in the pursuit of excellence".</p>
			<p>Nor is the University resting on its oars. It has a dynamic future vision. It is the pride of Mysore University's glorious traditions and its vision for the future which will preserve and ensure for it a place of preeminence in the intellectual life of the country. It is that pride in the past and the faith in the future which those who are graduating into the elite ranks of the alumni of this University today will carry with them as the precious and cherished gift of their alma mater. To them I offer my prayerful good wishes on this happy occasion and remind them of the immortal message our timeless heritage imparted in Taittiriya Upanishad calling upon those graduating and going to the battlefield of life to adhere to Truth, and to practice Dharma That ethical emphasis is the quintessential Indian legacy which ought to be the warp and woof of our life and learning. To that age old Upanishadiç convocation of Indian wisdom I would like to add expressly a mandate which is implicit in our heritage: Rashtradevo Bhav, Manushyadevo Bhav, Vishwadevo Bhav. That indeed is the clarion call of our time when we are embattled by many gigantic challenges, social, economic and political. They are challenges engendered by the revolution of rising expectations, by new and pressing demands of the re-emerging knowledge society and globalisation both of which were originally conceptualised by the ancient seers of India, by the alienation produced by the generation gap as well as disharmony created by social, economic and religious divisions and dichotomies, by narrow, regionalism and by widespread corruption in our society.</p>
			<p>There is today a crisis of values and of credibility. With all the achievements of our citizen entrepreneurs and the state sector, we are not meeting the desideratum of progress in proportion to our potential and capacities. The path to our tryst with destiny is strewn with thorns and obstacles which the civil society and State must remove ceaselessly and ruthlessly with a renewed civic and political will rooted in the confluence of our culture. We need to creatively redefine our national goals and our public discourse and reinvigorate our sense of national unity while protecting our cultural diversities. I plead for a reconciliation of Rights and Duties with a renewed cultural and educational emphasis on duties. I hope for the resurrection of the message of national integration and the reconstruction of our nationalism without compromising our commitment to a larger humanistic global perspective. Let us remember that India gave to the world the concept of global family (Vasudhaiv Kulumbakam) many millennia ago. I am all for our windows and doors to remain wide open for fresh breeze from all directions but obviously it would not do to be swept off our feet: it would not do to allow ourselves to be victims of any new predatory colonial exploitation in disguise. 1 hope and pray that our common people and our premier universities will together forge new bonds of partnership and prove to be the bastions of our national goals and ideals, our hopes and aspirations, our cultural heritage and our value system.</p>
			<p>Karnataka has long been the cradle and the confluence of synthesis, assimilation and osmosis. its antiquity goes back to the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, the Tirthankaras of the kin tradition, the many Buddhist legends and to the Mauryan empire of Chandragupta and Ashoka. Jainism, Veerashaivism, Vaishnavasm, and Islam have found expression in the literature, art, architecture, the way of life and the political history of Karnataka. The Kannada literature captures the essence of Dr. S. Radhakrishnan's statement that Indian literature is one though it is written in different Indian languages. That is the thought that is also beautifully encapsulated in the ode to Mother Karnataka as the daughter of Mother India:</p>
			<p class="myquote">Bharat Jananiya Tanujate<br /> Jai He Karnataka Mate!</p>
			<p>I conclude with a vivid and evocative description of what Karnataka means not only to Kannadigas but to all Indians:</p>
			<p>“To the housewife, Karnataka is sandalwood and silk, ivory carvings and incense-sticks. To the historian, it means Chalukyas, Kadambas, Rashtrakutas, Gangas, Hoysalas, the Rayas of Vijayanagar and Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. To the chronicler of Indian art, it signifies the caves of Badami and that amazing nursery of Indian temple building art the Aihole-Pattadakal complex, the serene and monumental image of the unadorned Gomateswara whose smile washes away the world's worries, the over-ornate voluptuous sculpture of Belur and Halebid and the sturdy domes of Bijapur and Bidar. To the lover of song, Karnataka means a whole school of musical articulation that embraces the entire south. To the philosopher it denotes the creeds of Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, Basaveshvara, the Shankaracharyas of Shringeri and the seer Vidvaranya. To the student of social change, Karnataka summons up pictures of that torchbearer of modernisation, Visvesvaraya, and the country's first hydroelectric station of Sivasamưdra, as well as the whole range of  pioneering industries in aviation, electronics, telecommunications and machine tools and the huge project of Tungabhadra and Sharavathy. To the man of business, Karnataka is areca nut from Shimoga, coffee from Chikmagalur, tobacco from cotton from Hubli and Gadag and iron ore from Bellary and Kudremukh. To the tourist, Karnataka is the elephant and bison herds of Bandipur and Nagarahole, the vigorous leaps and bounces of the Yakshagana dancers, the fountains of Brindavan, and the Vidhana Soudha”.</p>
			<p>To those all-encompassing associations and images in all their captivating fascination, I would like to add Mysore's Chamundeshwari, Atmavilas Ganesha and the rare VeenaGanesh, the symbol of harmonious, propitious and prosperous learning. I take this opportunity to pay to Karnataka my homage of affection and respect as an Indian who freely admits to being under the irresistible and hospitable spell of Karnataka, of Manasagangotri, of Mysore Vishwavidyanilaya and its Chancellor and Vice Chancellor. On this happy and auspicious occasion, on the last day of the year 2002, as we prepare to ring in the year 2003 and to embark on our New Year's journey, let me recall the precept of Lord Buddha: Be a lamp unto yourself and wish you the best that life and legacy of learning and culture offer in terms of self-fullillment and in terms of what each one of us can .contribute to the Commonwealth of Knowledge and to the happiness and the prosperity of the people of India and the Peoples of the World.﻿</p>

			<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">EIGHTY- FOURTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
			<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong>SRI R. CHIDAMBARAM</strong><br /><em> Principal Scientific Advisor to the Govt. of India<br />and<br /> DAE - Homi Bhabha Professor, Bhabha Atomic<br />Research Centre, Mumbai</em></p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>Thursday, January 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2004﻿</em></p>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>THE NEED FOR COHERENT SYNERGY</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
			<p><em>Hon'ble Chancellor T. N. Chaturvedi, other dignitaries on the dais, my young friends who are receiving their degrees today and ladies &#38; gentlemen,</em></p>
			<p>It is an honour to give the convocation address at one of the oldest Universities of India. The University came into existence in 1916 during the First World War as the sixth in the country and the first in the erstwhile princely state of Mysore. Many famous men have passed through the portals of this University and you young people are privileged to have studied in it. I did my Ph.D. in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, which is not far from here and I have very pleasant memories of my stay in Karnataka. The legendary engineer statesman Sir M. Visveswaraya, the then Dewan of Mysore, started and nourished this University. Among the many things he did, he introduced the concept of industrialization for reaching a high level of economic development akin to that of the then leading western countries. This is still true today, though there are many other things to be done. My definition of a 'Developed' India is “when the quality of life in rural India becomes comparable to the quality of life in the already developed countries.” And for this to happen, technology has to be taken to rural India. So we need large scale industrialization and we also need to downsize technology to suit rural needs.</p>
			<p><strong>Technology is Power</strong></p>
			<p>The modern futurologist Alvin Toffler has said some years back: <em>“Yesterday violence was power, today wealth is power and tomorrow knowledge will be power”</em>. What is the common thread in all this - Technology! So I paraphrase Toffler to say: “Technology is power”. And this is true today more than at any time in history, and this will continue to be so in the future. Technology domination is sought both by companies and by countries, in fields as diverse as human genomics and strategic weapon systems, through the instruments of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and Technology Control Regimes (TCR). So, in areas, which are commercially profitable or strategically important, technologies will continue to be denied to India. And India must counter this attempt by other countries towards technology domination by becoming self-reliant. I have been saying for many years now that ‘self-reliance should no longer be interpreted as self-sufficiency but as 'immunity against technology denial.'</p>
			<p>In today's world, self-reliance also does not mean avoidance of international scientific and technological cooperation. In fact, the latter is a must and today's India must take and must give in equal measure in international cooperation. That is India must go for international cooperation on an “equal partner' basis and must also participate in international ‘mega science' projects.</p>
			<p><strong>Technology Foresight to Become a ‘Developed' Country</strong></p>
			<p>For a decade and more, I have been suggesting that the appropriate measures of development for a developing country are only two - per capita electricity consumption and female literacy. Availability of electricity is essential to provide the basic amenities like pure drinking water, sanitation and proper health care. And also, without near-hundred percent literacy and without societal equity - evidenced inter italia through gender nondiscrimination - the fruits of science and technology will not fully reach rural India.</p>
			<p>What are the reasons for developing technology? I Think, they are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating national wealth</li>
				<li>Improving the quality of life of the people, particularly those living in rural areas, and</li>
				<li>Enhancing national security.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Choosing the right technologies to put the nation on the path of rapid development requires technology foresight.</strong></p>
			<p>Technology foresight involves determination of possible futures, taking into account existent as well as emerging technologies, and of strategies likely to yield the maximum economic, social and security benefits. Technology foresight must be distinguished from Technology. forecasting, which attempts prediction of future technological developments, without worrying about the impact of these developments on the economy, society or the environment. Technology foresight analysis has to be on a national perspective. If you ask questions in this context, the answer may sometimes be different from India and from, say, the United States of America. Examples are fast breeder reactors and rural food processing. It is important for India to reprocess the spent fuel and close the nuclear fuel cycle, because we have limited uranium reserves and the world's largest thorium reserves. U.S.A., with easy access to world's cheap uranium may put away the spent fuel as 'waste' for decades. But remember that plutonium, with its half-life of 24,000 years, is not running away anywhere. In fact, the later you reprocess, the easier it is because other radio activities would have died down significantly.</p>
			<p><strong>Critical Technologies for India</strong></p>
			<p>Technology foresight analysis helps in the selection of critical technologies for development at any point of time and this, as I said before, has to be based on a national perspective. India fortunately does not have to follow the trodden path of technology development; we can learn from the mistakes of others and we can leapfrog in some technologies.</p>
			<p>So what are the critical technologies for India today? India is a large country and its technology requirements also correspondingly span a wide range. It has to continue to develop strategic technologies -- nuclear, space and defense-related. Technologies related to energy security, food and nutritional security, health and water security, environmental security, advanced manufacturing and processing, advanced materials, etc. are all-important for us. We seem to have special talent for the so-called “knowledge-based” technologies (Information Technology and Biotechnology). Among all these, I place rural development-related technologies also at high priority.</p>
			<p><strong>The Importance of Nuclear Energy</strong></p>
			<p>For the next 20 years, India will have to rely mostly on coal-based thermal and hydroelectric power but, if a long-term view is taken, then nuclear becomes an inevitable option to satisfy India's future energy needs. The difficulties in building big hydroelectric plants, the fact that our coal reserves are finite, and that renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass, by and large, give small packets of energy, all point to this.</p>
			<p>In the early 1970s, two 220 MWe Pressurized heavy Water Reactors (PHWR) were being constructed at Rawatbhata in Rajasthan with Canadian collaboration, but the Canadians walked out halfway through the construction of these plants, because India conducted the peaceful nuclear explosion (PNE) test at Pokhran in 1974. However, these reactors were completed by Indian scientists and engineers. Two decades later, the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. (NPCIL) has constructed two completely new Indian designed PHWRs at Rawatbhata, RAPS3 and RAPS-4. Over the past 20-25 years, the amount of new technology that has been introduced into the PHWRs (pressurized heavy water reactors) is so extensive that sometimes these reactors are called INDU (where IN stands for India, D for deuterium, because this is a heavy water moderated and cooled reactor, and U for Uranium) instead of CANDU (where CAN stands for Canada).</p>
			<p>Over the years, the improvement in the performance of the Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), the mainstay of the Indian nuclear energy programme, has been spectacular Last year, a report by the CANDU Owners' Group revealed that, in the calendar year 2002, among the PHWRs around the world, the unit in Kakrapar (near Surat, Gujarat) had the highest capacity factor (98.4%), and that the average capacity factor was 1% more than the average capacity factor of LWRs (light water reactors) in the United States.</p>
			<p>Nine reactors are under construction in India today (two of them in Kaiga in Karnataka) to add 4460 MWe to the present 2720 MWe. All this has been possible because of the strong, support from the Government of India. So the target set by the Department of Atomic Energy in 1995 for the year 2020 of 20000 MWe seems achievable. Gestation periods are coming down and there is the good internal resource generation in NPCIL. Over the past 10-20 years, the industrial structure of India has changed tremendously to enable achieving such good capacity factors. The enhancement in the quality of services and equipments supplied by the manufacturing sector is symptomatic of India's present industrial potential. The nuclear technology foresight of Homi Bhabha, and other pioneers who worked with him, is evident from the three-stage nuclear power programme put in place by them. The first stage entails using natural uranium in heavy water reactors. Uranium contains two isotopes, while U-235 burns, U-238 gets converted into plutonium. The second stage involves setting up breeder reactors using this plutonium, and this technology is being developed in the Indira Gandhi Centre at Kalpakkam. The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) has worked extremely well since it was commissioned in 1985 and work has now started on the 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR). The third stage is to move on to thorium, because India has the world's largest reserves of thorium while it only has modest reserves of uranium.</p>
			<p>If we used the natural uranium we have in the so-called once-through fuel cycle, that is throw away the spent fuel as waste, the maximum power we will get from our proven uranium reserves is something like from one per cent of our coal reserves -- no big deal! If we take out the plutonium from the spent fuel and put it back into fast breeder reactors and also use thorium in their blankets and finally go into the thorium-uranium 233 cycle, our uranium and thorium reserves are something like 3 to 5 times of our coal reserves. So that is the pay-off for going into fast breeders and for closing the nuclear fuel cycle with thorium. Of course, all this would require a tremendous amount of research and development over the next few decades. That programme, which had been thought of by Homi Bhabha and other early pioneers and which has a sound foundation in indigenous R&#38;D and a self-reliant industrial infrastructure, is proceeding smoothly.</p>
			<p>The nuclear weapons programme to develop a credible minium nuclear deterrent, the spin-offs in agriculture, medicine, and industry, the development of major facilities for research like research reactors, particle accelerators, synchrotron radiation sources and related advanced instrumentation, are the other dimensions of our nuclear programme and some aspects of this programme are not sufficiently widely known. For instance, not many people know that a large percentage of breeders' groundnut grown in this country is based on the Trombay radiation mutant varieties. The radio-isotopes produced in BARC are used extensively in nuclear medicine and for diagnostics purposes and for treatment of cancer through teletherapy and brachytherapy.</p>
			<p>In India, nuclear technology has acted as a catalyst for nucleating many other high technologies — from parallel processing supercomputers to high quality welding. The most powerful parallel-processing supercomputers in India— the Anupam series – were developed at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.</p>
			<p><strong>The Importance of Rural Technologies</strong></p>
			<p>One of the areas of focus of the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India is related to the development and dissemination of technologies for rural development.</p>
			<p>The following two possible approaches have been identified in this context:</p>
			<p>(i) Collect all information on successful dissemination of technology in rural areas. The NIRD (National Institute of Rural Development), Hyderabad, has prepared a directory of rural technologies (four volumes) and is now selecting 20 - 25 among them, which have been most successful in the field. (There are also directories prepared by the CAPART, the ICAR and the CSIR).</p>
			<p>(ii) Find the technology needs in the field and identify technology solutions for the problems encountered.</p>
			<p>The ideal thing is for the two approaches to converge.</p>
			<p>There is practically no technology needed for rural development that is not available among, or which cannot be developed by, Indian scientists or by Indian industry; the problem often is in transferring it or in downsizing it, if necessary. Normally any technology is enlarged to benefit from economy of scale. If one increases the size then there is economy of scale even for nuclear reactors; instead of 225 MW, build 500 MW or 700 MW plants and the overall cost, including manpower cost per MW, comes down. On the other hand, what one loses in economy of scale by downsizing a technology for rural use, one can gain from the fact that the source of raw material in India - be it leather, milk, grain or anything else — is scattered and distributed. In this context, an international seminar was held during 7-9 October, 2003, in Bhubaneswar at the Regional Research Laboratory, a CSIR laboratory, on 'Downsizing Technology for Rural Development. There is no rural industry, for which there is not a modern counterpart. If the experts from modern industry can be encouraged to help their rural counterparts, it can also help transform rural India. This is being done for the pottery/ ceramics sector and can be done for the other sectors as well.</p>
			<p>The challenge is to establish synergy among all efforts, which are often fragmented and needlessly duplicated, to disseminate rural development technologies and to nucleate new initiatives and to strengthen existing ones. RuТAGs (Rural Technology Action Groups), that could provide the mechanism and the support needed for this synergy, have accordingly, been conceptualized; this has been done with the help of Scientific Consultants in the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, who are experts in various aspects of rural development.</p>
			<p>The entities which are intended to be brought together by RuTAG are broadly:</p>
			<p>(i) A consortium of S &#38; T Institutions working in the area.</p>
			<p>(ii) A consortium of S &#38; T NGOs and voluntary agencies active in the area.</p>
			<p>(iii) A consortium of Public Sector Undertakings (PS Us) and Corporate Industrial houses in the private sector committed to rural development and having a presence in the area.</p>
			<p>(iv) A consortium of State and Central Government organizations already working for rural development in the area.</p>
			<p>RuTAG is planned as a synergizing and catalyzing mechanism, and not a major funding mechanism. It can, however, also provide help and advice in seeking funds from other agencies. RuTAG in fact, is an evolving concept.</p>
			<p><strong>Academia-Industry Interaction</strong></p>
			<p>Reverting to hi-tech industry, we have success stories in atomic energy, space, etc. the outcomes of successful interactions between academia and industry. However, the driving force for these interactions came from mission-oriented agencies.In the case of atomic energy, the driving force for the successful academia-industry interaction came from the Department of Atomic Energy. The issue is : can we have a similarly strong academia-industry interaction when the driving force has to come from the industry ? So far there has been a mindset problem in scientists and industry leaders, which has prevented this from happening in significant measure; however, this is changing in the current liberalized environment. Technology transfer from abroad is becoming more and more difficult because foreign companies can set up shop here and are, therefore, less willing to share technologies. I have been told by many industrialists that, even in joint ventures, the foreign companies are trying to buy out the Indian partners! The good news for the Indian scientists is that Indian industry will, therefore, in the future go more and more to - Indian R&#38;D for new technology. However, mature industries and new industries require different mechanisms and approaches. The approach for mature industries like steel, fertilizer, sugar, and textiles has to be different from, say, the pharmaceutical industry, where someone is trying to discover a new drug molecule. If it is a new industry or a new product or process, research can be undertaken in somewhat isolation in the laboratory and the results of the research transferred to the industry. On the other hand, if it is a mature industry then, like Dr. J.J. Irani of Tata Sons says, 'the scientists have to work in the actual plant environment'. That is, scientists have to improve the quality of the product or to improve the energy efficiency of the process. If industry begins to interact actively with academia, it can also play a greater role in guiding academic activities in the direction of industry interests, be it HRD (Human Resource Development), R &#38; D prioritization, or the choice of areas of international cooperation.</p>
			<p>At the end of several academia-industry interaction meetings in the PSA's Office, we came up with a series of recommendations. Very often people with degrees in engineering don't go in for research and technology development, even though they may have a talent for it, but opt for jobs in 1T, management, or just go abroad. Now, if the industry were to send some fresh employees (from among those they recruit during placement interviews in academic institutions), the most talented among them, to do research with a professor whom the industry respects and in institutions that they respect, and pay them company salaries, then there would be greater scope for industry-oriented research. Although the employee might not be addressing the company's problems consciously, subconsciously the company's products would manifest in his thoughts and actions in all professional interactions. Over a period of 4-5 years, he could evolve into someone very useful for the company's product or process development</p>
			<p>Dr. J.J. Irani and I have sent a joint letter in this context to about 50 private sector enterprises and 20 public sector companies, and the reaction from industry leaders has been positive. Even when a technology is imported, academia expertise should be utilized by industry for technology assessment, upgradation, and absorption to ensure that the acquired technology is suitable for indigenous raw materials and indigenously fabricated equipment.</p>
			<p>SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) have to be dealt differently. Large enterprises generally have their own R&#38;D centres, but SMEs do not have the resources for trying out a new idea or process and for carrying out R&#38;D. Thus, the concept of incubation centres’ is very important for SMEs.</p>
			<p>There must be flexibility in the rules of the academia to encourage interaction with industry, and this is beginning to happen. The IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology), the IlSc, etc. are willing to play a more proactive role.</p>
			<p><strong>The Automotive Sector</strong></p>
			<p>The process of creating a user-friendly database of professors and scientists, who are willing and capable of interacting with the industry, has started with the automotive sector. This was one of the suggestions of the members of the industry during the academia-industry interaction meetings I referred to earlier. A core group for R &#38; D in the automotive sector, appropriately called CAR, has been formed and one of its first recommendations was that we should not stop with the database of scientists. There was also a need to identify emerging frontier technologies in the automotive sector. Tomorrow's car, with 40% of its functions computerized, is going to be a virtual computer on wheels. So work has to be done on embedded systems and there are many other frontier areas, and six expert panels have been formed. If this is successful for the automotive sector, then TIFAC (Technology Information and Forecasting Assessment Council) of the Department of Science and Technology, which is the secretariat for this effort, would carry out similar exercises for other important technologies.</p>
			<p><strong>Patterns and Priorities in Indian R&#38;D</strong></p>
			<p>Indians feel proud when there are achievements in basic research of a high order like the work of Srinivasa Ramanujan, C.V. Raman, S. Chandrasekhar, S.N. Bose, M.N. Saha or Hargobind Khorana. These are men who charted their own scientific paths. Indians also feel proud when there are technological achievements of a high order like the commissioning of a nuclear power plant or carrying out of nuclear tests, putting a satellite into orbit or successful test launching of a missile.</p>
			<p>India is a large country, and therefore it should be present in every frontier area of science and of high technology. But how much we invest in each area, at any point of time, requires careful and wise analysis taking our national interests into account. Frederick Seitz says: “The advance of science requires money given with appreciation and wisdom, but the amounts must be determined by many complex factors”.</p>
			<p>An important factor which influences the pursuit of R&#38;D in India is what I have called many years back as “Velocity of R &#38; D’. This is a relative velocity, and is a ratio of the time our peers abroad take to complete an R &#38; D project in a frontier area of S &#38; T and the time we take to complete a similar project. Though things have improved considerably over the last couple of decades, our velocity of R &#38; D is still lower than that in a developed country. There are many reasons for this, including infrastructure weaknesses, communication inadequacies, bureaucratic delays, non-availability of industrial products from local sources, insufficient access to scientific literature, lack of adequate peer groups, inadequate synergy between the national Laboratory System and the University System, etc. But the important fact is that things are improving in the country acrossthe-board. When the velocity of our R&#38;D comes on par with that in the developed countries, India will see spectacular technology growth and we should all work towards that.</p>
			<p>I have classified the types of R &#38; D work done in India today into several categories (see Current Science, Vol. 77, pp. 859-866, 10 October, 1999)</p>
			<p>Viewing broadly, one can answer the question: "What kind of R &#38; D is important for India?" By saying:</p>
			<p>(i) Globally competitive basic research (without too much concern about impact on Indian technology)</p>
			<p>(ii) Research and Development, that feeds Indian technology industry needs and requirements of critical technologies.</p>
			<p><strong>Synergy Projects</strong></p>
			<p>The scientific business of the government is allocated among various scientific departments, but there are areas, which do not quite fall into any department's turf, and there are other areas, parts of which fall into the territories of several departments. For instance, the Prime Minister's directive to the SAC-C (Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet) and the PSA to make recommendations to 'reduce bureaucratism in science', or the measurement of progress of S &#38; T in India, in all its ramifications -- from basic research to rural development-related technologies - are examples of the former category. Enhancing academia industry interaction and a comprehensive study of energy technologies in a national perspective are examples of the latter category. The PSA's Office is, therefore, taking up what it calls ‘Synergy Projects”. These are essentially studies and pilot projects, which can nucleate or catalyze large multi-disciplinary projects or help in networking institutions whose work has a common objective but the efforts are presently fragmented. These projects would relate to national development or (explicitly or implicitly) to national security. These projects are different in concept from the conventional projects of various departments, each with a well-defined mandate. They are more in the nature of evolving projects in response to urgent national S &#38; T needs, as perceived from time to time, and this response has to be quick.</p>
			<p>Scientists are beginning to learn a great deal from living systems; neural networks are a common method of optimization in science. Another method is that of GAS (genetic algorithms) used essentially when a number of disparate factors have to be considered for optimization. For instance, in building a dipole magnet when, in addition to taking into account its magnetic field, focusing properties, and the like, the ease of fabrication is also considered, then optimization becomes very difficult. GАs are ideal optimization tools to search for the global minimum or maximum of functions spanning such large multidimensional and non-linear spaces: Create ‘chromosomes' with all the features sought in the solution and analyse them through a 'fitness function'. Reject those too far from the optimum, have cross-over and mutations until the optimum solution is reached. The philosophy behind this technique, I think, can be effectively used to search for optimum technology-related solutions to national problems. The binary option (approved/not approved), usual in bureaucratic decision-making, is a serious handicap to R &#38; D projects. If a concept is valuable, the system must help in developing the project, and not just accept or reject an initial formulation. Scientists must have flexibility to evolve'a (high-risk) frontier area project over its lifetime as they compete with scientists in developed countries.</p>
			<p><strong>The Need for Coherent Synergy</strong></p>
			<p>Every S &#38; T effort towards national development or national security requires synergy among the concerned parties and coherence collectively among all the eforts. 'Coherent Synergy' is a new phrase I have coined! Every synergetic S&#38;T effort gives a momentum for development and momentum is a vector, which implies that it has the essential component of direction. All vectors must point in the same direction, for fast growth. Synergy in any effort has local coherence, of course, but “coherent synergy' has global coherence. If we can bring coherent synergy in all our efforts, then India can develop very fast. The Prime Minister has envisaged an 8% annual GNP growth rate and the management guru C. K. Prahlad considers even higher growth rates possible. And I agree! In any physical phenomenon, the initial growth rates are very fast and then saturation sets in. Economic growth is somewhat similar. The United States, for example, cannot grow at six or eight per cent because it has already reached a very high level of development and there is not much space to grow; that is why its growth rate has flattened out. China has grown fast recently, because it is in the initial stages of growth and so can India. But to do that, we need 'coherent synergy</p>
			<p><strong>A Matter of Character</strong></p>
			<p>There is a verse in the Gita (Chapter II, Verse 57), which is normally translated as “He, who is, unattached on any side, who when he comes upon good or evil neither rejoices nor is dejected, is poised in wisdom”. This has been adapted in translation for the definition of the character of a true scientist by my friend Shri C. V. Sundaram: “A true scientist has to be a Sthithapragnya. He is an individual with an open mind, unaffected by personal inclinations. He accepts results (of experimental observations or theoretical calculations) as they come, pleasant or unpleasant. He is not swayed by emotions of elation or of disappointment. He stays steadfast and uncompromising in his search for truth”.</p>
			<p>To achieve anything in life requires character. To be a good and honest administrator requires character. To be an incorruptible politician requires character. To be a good soldier or a scientist requires character. Albert Einstein has said: “Most people say that it is the intellect which makes a great scientist. They are wrong; it is the character". This is a profound statement. This does not mean that anyone can do great science. High intellect is necessary but not sufficient; character is more important. The definition of character is however, not easy. Character means integrity; it means pursuit of excellence within the individual's limitations, of course; it means perseverance in the face of adversity; it means commitment to national and social causes; and it means also a commitment to justice and social equity.</p>
			<p>To build India into an economically developed, scientifically advanced and militarily strong nation, the country requires people with character. Politicians, administrators, lawyers, soldiers, scientists, technologists, specialists and skilled people of numerous other disciplines—all with character! Many among you will become leaders who will take this country forward in the coming years and I exhort you to remember the importance of character of the individual citizen in national development and national security.</p>
			<p>I wish all of you young people all the best in the future.﻿</p>

			<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">EIGHTY- FIFTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
			<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong> DR. SUBHASH C. KASHYAP</strong><br /><em>Honorary Research Professor<br /> Centre for Policy Research (CPR)<br />New Delhi</em></p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>Thursday, December 9<sup>th</sup>, 2004﻿</em></p>
			<p><em>Excellency, the Chancellor, Shri Chaturvedi, Hon'ble Vice-Chancellor, Professor Prasad, other Luminaries on the dais, distinguished Members of the Academic and Executive Councils of the University, learned Deans and Professors, eminent scholars and citizens, young graduates and my dear fellow students:</em></p>
			<p>Ideem it an honour and a privilege to be invited to deliver the 85th Convocation Address at this highly prestigious and in many ways pioneering University of Mysore. I feel deeply beholden. Also, I have fond memories of my earlier visits to this city of beauty and culture. The last time I was here was to participate in the international conference on Kautilya's Arthasastra at your Oriental Research Institute. I shall specially cherish the present visit for the opportunity of speaking in the august presence of the most distinguished scholar, administrator and educationist in the presence of His Excellency, the Chancellor, Shri Chaturvedi.</p>
			<p>Name so some of the most outstanding sons of India are associated with the establishment and running of this University. As I stand here in the endearing campus with the fascinating name, <em>Manasagangotri,</em> I experience the vibrations of the entire environs saturated with the spirit of the great visionaries, the late Maharaja His Highness Sri Krishnaraja Wadeyar Bahadur IV and his talented Dewan Sir M. Vishweshvariah. The rulers of Mysore - the successive Maharajas and Dewans - were some of the most enlightened, progressive and far-sighted administrators. I take this opportunity to offer my respectful homage to their memory.</p>
			<p>With its thrust on quality and academic excellence, the University of Mysore, in its 88 years' life, has represented the highest traditions of our rich heritage and sublime culture. It has remained true to its motto “Na hi gyanen sadrasham' - there is nothing like knowing. One who knows the truth that purifies the soul goes far beyond mere knowledge. When the spaces between the knower and the known disappear, one really knows and attains ‘gyan'.</p>
			<p>To those of you of the bright new generation who are now graduating and the scholars who are today passing out from this great institution with higher degrees, I offer my heartiest congratulations on their achievements and best wishes for a glorious future of self fulfillment and service to the nation.</p>
			<p>It is customary to give the tongue-in-cheek advice to new graduates to follow the path of rectitude and righteousness in the face of all the travails, tribulations and temptations in life. As I said recently in a convocation address at another University, I do not think I am in any position to offer such advice to you because I believe that it is my generation that has failed you. Our elders had placed before us some ideals and values by imbibing them in their own lives. Their lives presented before us a model to be emulated and a message to be followed. But, we were able to be role models and provide inspiration to today's youth. Actually, our generation has done such violence to all the ideals and values and presented such as ugly example before you that we must hang our heads in shame. In education, politics, morality and all other fields, we have failed to do what we should have done and alone all that we should have never done.</p>
			<p>In a sense, it is also a matter of pity that concern for advising the youth in matters of discipline, character, conduct and observance of duties, is becoming a preoccupation of the older generation. We seem very anxious to advice the youth to develop their morals. We, the elders - the teachers and the parents of today - are like Nachiketa's father - Vajasrava - in the <em>Kathaopanishad;</em> we do not realize that we are really the guilty generation. We do nothing about our own value system and pay no attention to our own morals, character and conduct. We forget that the youth do not learn from what the teachers and the parents say but from what they do. Before advising you, we must ask ourselves, what examples we have placed before you by our own lives.</p>
			<p>While speaking to you today, I am conscious of the fact that there is nothing new in what I am saying. Others have said it and even I have said it all before. But, as Andre Gide once said, since nobody listens, it needs to be said again and again.</p>
			<p>I believe, our original sin, during the last fifty-four years of our Republic has been that we did not give due importance to education in the national agenda. Education was sadly neglected for long and occupied one of the lowest positions in national priorities. Otherwise, there was no reason why in more than half a century, free and compulsory education to all could not be made a reality or why widespread illiteracy could not be eradicated. In fact, today, India has more illiterates than it had at the time of independence. Among all the countries, we have the largest number of illiterate people.</p>
			<p>The National Commission appointed in the year 2000 on the completion of 50 years of the working of the Constitution wanted the right to free education being made a fundamental right for all children upto the age of 14 and for girls and members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes upto the age of 18. Also, the Commission felt that in an increasingly knowledgebased and knowledge-driven society, it was of the utmost importance to accord primacy to quality of higher education and research.</p>
			<p>The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 seeks to repair the situation somewhat in the matter of universalisation of education for the children. It is to be hoped that it will be implemented and simultaneously equal attention paid to higher education and research.</p>
			<p>Powerful foreign lobbies would like India not to lay emphasis on higher education. It is like the mischievous and motivated suggestion that India should lay emphasis on agriculture and production of raw materials only. While there is every reason to ensure universalisation of primary education, it would be a disaster if higher education is ignored in the name of primary education. It is not an either/or scenario. Both are necessary and have to be addressed at the same time. With all its short comings, it is, after all, because of higher education that Indians can compete with foreigners in all international fora.</p>
			<p>Higher education is not merely imparting of information or knowledge. It should aim at total development of a person. It must train the student to be a good citizen and to be able to take decisions and act wisely in life. Wisdom is the ability to discriminate and decide between right and wrong. The objective of higher education is to inculcate such wisdom.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately in the 21st century world, all concepts of right and wrong are blurred. There has been a general devaluation of all values in every walk of life. The only values, if any left are money, power and success.</p>
			<p>In today's scenario, it is difficult to find those who want to better the world around or to ameliorate the sufferings of fellow human beings or to suffer and sacrifice for a cause or even to bother about matters like character building. Qualities of education and training that ensure the growth of such beings are not in demand. The market forces are at work and what is asked for is orientation for securing a paying job and training in the methodologies and techniques for getting things done, for fixing deals and forging ahead. It was an astounding experience when recently a candidate for a job revealed during the interview that he has done a professional course in how to get things done; in other words, he claimed expertise in bribe giving or in finding the weakness of the concerned person and exploiting it.</p>
			<p>Experience has taught the new generation that success stories are built not in pursuing 'ideals' but on negotiating profitable ‘deals”. Competitive consumerism, multiplication of wants, hedonism, stark materialism and unabashed possessivism have become the yardsticks of respect in society. We do not even talk of the old ideals of Aparigrah, Asteya, limitation or minimization of wants, sacrificing for fellow human beings, selfrestraint and simple living and high thinking. Since everything around seems rotten, we tend to withdraw into shells of privatism and make selfishness not only the greatest but the only feasible virtue. The goals become making big money quick, achieving status and living well. Character and individuality lose all significance. Worldly success, comfort and vulgar exhibitionism become the most important concerns.</p>
			<p>Here the ways of men part. Each one has to decide for himself whether he adopts the difficult path of life-long struggle in the pursuit of truth and knowledge with commitment to some higher values or he would rather have success, power and wealth at any cost, by any means and lead a comfortable life. My young friends, I shall like to share with you what a professor of mine told me when 1 was leaving the university more than half-acentury back. He said:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>“Subhash, 10-15 years from now, if someone came to me and told me that so and so had become a great man, I would stop and ask him whether he had remained a good man. But if he were to tell me that so and so had emerged as a good human being, I would not bother to ask him if he had also become great".</em></p>
			<p>If success is not the highest value and if we value our values more, success may have to be sacrificed and failure preferred. There is less competition and more happiness for those who choose to sacrifice and serve rather than make all sorts of compromises to achieve success, power and riches.</p>
			<p>Universities are the repositories of the accumulated wisdom and cultural heritage of centuries. They are storehouses of knowledge and creators of those who create and make knowledge grow. Universities are expected to attract the best brains and be centres for achieving excellence and for inculcation of higher values leading to the development of the personality of each individual to its fullest potential and nation. Higher education in the transformation of our institution and values. The function of a University, according to Jawaharlal Nehru was to train the student in body, mind and spirit. While delivering a convocation address at the Allahabad University, he said "a University stands for humanism, for tolerance, for reason, for progress, for the adventure of ideas, and for the search for truth. It stands for the onward rays towards even higher objectives. If the Universities discharge their duties properly then it is well with the nation”.</p>
			<p>Looked at from another angle, probably society has come to an impasse because there is some disconnect between societal needs and university education. It is sometime said that the education imparted at the colleges and universities must be relevant to social needs or, in other words, it must be related to the availability of jobs in different discipline and to meeting real life problems in today's world. But, education for character building and for learning the skills for job or profession etc. cannot be separated from each other. Nor can they be viewed separately. They have all to be accepted as essential parts of the educational process. It is natural to expect that education would enable the student to face the ordeals of the struggle of life, to meet his needs and sort out his personal problems. To equip him for a vocation of his liking and enabling him to earn his livelihood and the basic comforts of life. Ancient Indian wisdom does not preach a spiritual education devoid of practical training for life. On the completion of the course of education, at the time of convocation, the Guru used to tells his disciples not to transgress truth and dharma but at the same time not to ignore their well being or needs of their worldly comforts and prosperity either.</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>Satyam Pramaditavyam<br /> Dharman Pramaditavyam<br /> Kushlan Pramaditavyam<br /> Bhutyain Pramaditavyam</em></p>
			<p>Thus, <em>Tatreyopanishad</em> does not teach utopian idealism or mere spiritual knowledge. It attaches due importance to the physical worldly needs as well and regards them as essential.</p>
			<p>There is another dimension to the challenges to higher education in the 21st century. The context of higher education has changed with the aggressive advent of economic liberalisation, market globalisation and technological leap forward into an information age and a knowledge-based society.</p>
			<p>The world during this short period has seen many changes affecting the institutions, society, polity, market, culture, as well as the overall thinking of men. Higher education is not immune to this whole process. The whole concept of higher education as we conceive it today is getting eroded with new conditions that are evolving. Challenges are due to the changed conditions, which demand a fresh look, an understanding of changing conditions and the fulfilment of required needs.</p>
			<p>It is often said that we are passing through critical times. Myriads of problems confront us. But, problems are part of life. The living always have problems. It is only the dead who have no problems. Every problem that comes our way is a challenge to be faced, an opportunity to be seized. Even failures need not dishearten us. With a positive view, we, in fact, learn more from failures than from successes.</p>
			<p>A developing country like India particularly depends for its progress and survival on modern knowledge and technological innovations. Indian universities like the Mysore University are capable of providing leadership in this regard by making advanced research relevant to present day societal needs and one that impacts national developments and policy formulation.</p>
			<p>In the modern world, knowledge and technology advance at the speed of hurricanes. Sometimes centuries get compressed into years. To remain apposite and relevant the courses and curricula in universities need to be under constant review. Newer and newer disciplines and sub-disciplines have to be added from time to time. It seems to me that apart from courses to cover new disciplines in the fields of science and emerging new technologies, we need to revamp our curricula in social science also. For instance, there is considerable justification for having separated courses in interdisciplinary fields like Political Sociology, Geo-politics, Political Economy, etc. There may be need for courses in Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation mechanisms, Citizenship Education (covering education in and for democracy, rights and duties of citizens, participation and responsibility), Political Management including election campaign management, media management, floor management, legislative process and management, information management. I was quite pleased to see that your University has a full course in ‘Christianity'. The University authorities may like to consider also having courses in comparative religions, ‘Islam', 'Hinduism’, Yoga, etc.</p>
			<p>Also, it seems to me that India has a tremendous potential to become a global education mart with excellent educational facilities at very affordable cost. Once again, Indian universities can attract students from far and near as did the great centres of learning in Taxila, Nalanda and Varanasi. India can once again play the role of <em>Vishwa Guru.</em></p>
			<p>Globalisation and the scenario of a stiff competitive process in the emerging international knowledge market make it imperative for our universities to care for high quality and achieve international standards. Our boys and girls are second to none is amply proved. Our universities and institutes of higher education can evolve programs that are flexible and cost-effective. At the entrepreneurial level, research in consumer goods and services and other usersectors must get top priority as free-flow or dumping of massproduced foreign goods and services may ruin Indian enterprise with far reaching social, political and economic consequences. It would be most advisable and necessary to device a number of courses that are market-friendly and commercially viable. Need based skills would have to be developed and scope for selffinancing vocationalisation can be explored. Universities can be linked to big business houses and should be able to undertake consultancy, laboratory tests etc. for private parties. Care has to be taken to ensure that fundamental research and study in areas like linguistics, literature, fine arts, philosophy, social sciences and humanities or in pure sciences do not become a casualty and that the universities continue to remain centres of pursuit of excellence in areas of fundamental research. The new challenges demand new opportunities and delivery systems, new attitudes and flexibility and openness to harness the great potential of technology for quality education as well as societal needs.</p>
			<p>A major problem facing us today is that human worth has come to be measured in economic terms. Man himself has become a machine and a commodity that can be bought and sold. But, dear friends, may I submit that it is wrong to premise that human beings are merely a resource to be developed or that man is valuable only because he or she can be used as material for reaching higher levels of GNP or GDP or for realising greater industrial production and maximisation of profitability. The concept of human beings as a resource has become fashionable and embedded in our management and official discourse today as if human beings are merely cannon fodder, only a resource like iron ore or coal. In fact, human personality-individual and in collectivity-should be regarded as the ultimate end purpose and not a means for anything else. All our development agenda and education must aim at producing vigorous individuals, powerful characters, complete mature and integrated personalities.</p>
			<p>For thousands of years, the highest thinking in India has been that of the superiority of moral and spiritual values to material wealth and worldly attainments. Sacrifice of self interest to help and serve others has always commanded respect and love of the people. But, efforts at bringing about abiding harmony between individuals and collectives have so far failed. And they have failed because we have not recognised the centrality of the spirit and the imperative of its rule. To the extent that the society today considers affluence and material success (to the exclusion of spiritual progress) as the supreme values, it is sick.</p>
			<p>The old fashioned wisdom that our elders tried to impart to us in childhood said that, “when money is lost, nothing is lost, when health is lost, something is lost but when character is lost, everything is lost.” The position today has been exactly reversed. We have come to believe that character is an obstacle in the path of progress in life that character is an easily expendable commodity and that money and success are the ultimate values.</p>
			<p>Education must develop character along with ability for independent and critical thinking. Education is what remains with us after we forget all the subjects that we might have learnt at the university. Education is a continuous and lifelong process of learning. We can learn even from a fool. In fact, as the Greek thinker Cato said, the wise learn more from fools than fools learn from wise men. Education does not end with leaving the university. It is essentially the process of development of individuality, selfhood and character. In the words of Swami Vivekananda:</p>
			<p>“Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brain and runs riot there, undigested all your life. We must have life-building, man-making, character-making, assimilation of ideas... The ass carrying its load of sandalwood knows only the weight not the value of sandalwood. If education is identical with information, the libraries are the greatest sages in the world, the encyclopedias are the Rishis."</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>Yatha Kharas Chandan Bharvahi<br /> Bharasya Vetta, Na Tu Chandansya</em></p>
			<p>This message was for an education that produces men who had conquered fear and were full of energy and faith in themselves. His advice to the youth was to be strong, to acquire power and strength and to conquer weakness and fear, to forge ahead, to become man. Undigested knowledge becomes poison and is dangerous. Learning without the ability of discrimination can be grossly misused.</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>Sakshara Viparita Rakshasa Bhavanti</em></p>
			<p>The youth of today need not have blind faith in anything, in any one. True faith is the name given to full confidence in one's own self. If we develop this power of confidence in self, become strong, brave and fearless in body, mind, heart and character, obstacles in the path will themselves disappear, barriers will break down and problems will stand resolved. It is said, “tough times rarely last, tough people do”. In all humility, I will like to add that if you have faith in yourself, you will find your own answers. We have no answers to your questions. And, if we try to advise you, I for one, would say, please do not follow us. Carve your own path.</p>
			<p>It is a pity that any talk about values and morals as about culture is considered non-secular. Thousands of years ago, our common ancestors who incidentally were neither Hindus, nor Muslims, nor Christians, asked of themselves a question: Who am I, where did I come from, what is the aim of life, what heights of excellence can a man achieve?</p>
			<p>The <em>Upanishads</em> teach us that fundamentally there is the same Atman in every being. In reality, one is only Atman. Thus conceived, there is no high or low. Every member of society is equally important. Everyone has his own place of pride and honour because behind his individuality is his Atman-eternal, infinite and immortal. The human personality owes its creative energy and the spirit of oneness and equality to the Atman. How can such knowledge be non-secular. True education awakens the consciousness of the oneness of family, neighborhood, society, nation and lastly humanity at large. All the walls of high and low are pulled down. In every other man, the individual sees himself. He begins to wish for everyone as for himself. He feels the pain and sorrow of every other human being as his own:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>Vaishnav Jan To Tene Kahiye,<br /> Je Pir Parayi Jane Re.</em></p>
			<p class="myquote">or as Walt Whitman said:</p>
			<p class="myquote">I do not ask the wounded man how he feels,<br /> I myself become the wounded man.</p>
			<p>The sphere of 'l' gets so widened that it comes to encompass within it the entire humanity. The individual comes to feel and realise within himself the whole universe. Once the drop knows it is water, the drop and the limitless sea are one and the same. This is the concept of Shankar's advait when the sense of the other, of duality disappears.</p>
			<p>Real happiness consists not in bhog or enjoyment but in tyag or sacrifice. Isopanishad speaks of</p>
			<p class="myquote">Tena tyaktena bhunjitha<br /> [Enjoying life through renunciation]</p>	
			<p>The concept of modern democracy also lays great stress on non-discrimination and participatory equal-ity of all human beings in the system. But, the hard truth is that in the absence of any education of the spirit, society gets divided on grounds of narrow parochial loyalties based on language, religion, race, caste, region, etc. The dividing lines get more and more widened. Social incongruities and tensions keep multiplying. And, we can have no respite from all this unless we seek shelter in spiritual education and its quintessential of quality, unity and integrity.</p>
			<p>Increase in wealth and prosperity does not necessarily add to human happiness. Power, position and worldly riches do not reduce sorrow. Despite all the physical possessions and comforts one cannot be the master of life and experience the real joy of living. He is reduced to being a slave to these worldly things. We know how Nachiketa refuses all offers of material prosperity and prefers to seek ‘shreyas' to 'preyas'.</p>
			<p>What is needed is a new beginning for national regeneration. India has a destiny to realise and a vision to give to humanity. Nations which lose their vision perish. Societies which fail to transmit to their children their heritage, the quintessence of the accumulated wisdom of centuries and a system of values are relegated to debris. The rubble and the shambles of history and the stories of dead civilizations are a mute testimony to many such fallen stars.</p>
			<p>I have great faith in the Youth of India. The students are the future of India. They represent the future of humanity. The anguished world of today needs the vision and the light that only India of tomorrow can provide. From within the youth the soul of India would once again rise, awakening would dawn, light would shine, national regeneration would follow.</p>
			<p>Darkness may be very deep, but for that very reason, every small candle, every single lamp would shine more brightly. Education is the name of the lamp lighting the other. If everyone becomes a lamp that lights another, all despair and darkness shall disappear. We have to give up all defeatism and escapism, fulfill our role, surge forward and assume responsibility.</p>
			<p>I would once again congratulate the new graduates, wish them the very best and conclude with the invocation of my favourite <em>Kathopanishad:</em></p>
			<p class="myquote">Utishthat Jaagrat Prapya Varannibodhat<br /> Kshurasya Dhara Nishita Duratya Durg<br /> Pathastat Kavyo Vadanti</p>
			<p>Arise, awake. The path is sharp as razor's edge, hard to cross and difficult to tread but we must march on till the Goal is reached</p>

			<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">EIGHTY-SIXTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
			<p class="text-center">By<br />JUSTICE R.C. LAHOTE<br /> Former Chief Justice, Supreme Court of India</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em><strong>Monday, January 16<sup>th</sup>, 2006﻿</strong></em></p>
			<p><em>Your Excellency, Sri. T.N. Chaturvedi, Governor of Karna-taka and the Chancellor of University of Mysore, eminent faculty and members of the teaching staff, distinguished in-vitees and my dear young students.</em></p>
			<p>I gratefully acknowledge the gesture of His Excellency, Sri. Chaturvedi and Prof. Prasad for giving me this opportu-nity of being in the campus of this institution, a great centre of learning and sharing my views with the brilliant students who have successfully completed their courses of study and are being conferred with degrees and honours today. Hearty congratulations to all of them! You have every reason to feel jubilant and celebrate this day as it is one of the most mem-orable days of your life and career.</p>
			<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
			<p>The University of Mysore established in the year 1916 now stands at the grand age of ninety years. It is a destination of quality education and platform of structured educational administration. Not only it is an educational institution of eminence in India but it has also come to be accepted as a global destination for higher education. Students from more than 45 contest for the limited seats at this University. This day we must fondly remember Sri Krishnraja Wodeyar IV, the then Maharaja of Mysore, who established this University on July 27, 1916 with the able assistance of his Dewan Sir M. Vishweswaraiah who was later on decorated with the Bharat Ratna. Ever since the establishment of this University, there has been a thrust on quality and excellence in academics. No wonder the University has earned several laurels and has been rated with Five Stars by the national Assessment and Accreditation Council for its outstanding academic achievements.</p>
			<p>The University has certain natural advantages account of its being located in Mysore. Mysore is known as the cultural capital of the State of Karnataka. It has great heritage in the fields of art, architecture, education, literature and progressive administration. The city is matchless in its ideal blend of tradition and modernity. The temperate climate throughout the year along with a tradition of peace and prosperity makes the University conducive for quality education. A student in this university has dual benefits; he is instructed by the most learned, and, at the same time he breathes into his lungs and thereby imbibes into his personality cultural values effortlessly, just by being here.</p>
			<p><strong>Beginning of a Journey</strong></p>
			<p>A convocation is the coming together of the teacher and the taught bidding goodbye to each other with a smile which emerges on the lips by the hard-earned success - an outcome of the collective efforts of all those who matter in imparting and learning instructions. A convocation is an occa-sion to take stock in retrospect and of prospects; to cast a glance on the path already trodden and at the same time to look forward and envisage the journey which lies ahead so as to prepare oneself for it. Some of you would be embark-ing upon higher studies and some of you would be leaving the campus to plunge into an ocean called world with all its harsh realities. What would you aim at? What would you seek to achieve? The answer is provided by the emblem of the University The University emblem states <em>“Satyamevod-daharamyaham’</em>which means “I always uphold the truth'. This affirmation of yours should always continue to be your benchmark. What is this truth? What is its meaning and relevance for you in the present context?</p>
			<p>The truth is that as a human being you have to be use-ful to the society. You are fortunate enough to have been born in your motherland as a free nation. You have not suf-fered the bonds of slavery. Though the dream of free India has been fulfilled; but a developed India as visualized by Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, the Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution and all those who laid their lives for giving us freedom-is yet to be achieved. I am a person belonging to the field of Law and Justice. Time and again, I am reminded of the Preamble to the Constitution of India wherein it has been declared that we, the people of India, have solemnly resolved to secure to all the citizens of India justice, liberty, equality and fraternity assuring the dig-nity of the individual and the unity and the integrity of the Nation. How do we achieve that? What can be the contri-bution of each one of us in materializing the vision of India 2020, a concept mooted by His Excellency Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India. While fundamental rights are guaranteed by our Constitution, the key to achieve the goal of universal justice is provided in the Article dealing with the fundamental duties. The most relevant and im-portant clause defining the fundamental duties and which is of particular significance to the students is a reminder of our duty to strive towards excellence in all spheres of indi-vidual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement'. It is this striving for excellence' wherein lies the solution of all our problems and also the key for building a free India—a developed India. My message through this convocation address to you dear students, marching ahead whether for pursuing higher studies or for embarking upon a career, is that you must always strive for excellence, individually and collectively.</p>
			<p><strong>Some Thoughts on Education</strong></p>
			<p>Knowledge is source of power and education is source of knowledge. However, education is not just stuffing the minds of the students with bookish knowledge. According to Bertrand Russell and Gandhiji, the purpose of education is to develop an integrated personality. Unfortunately our present education system is, by and large, a part of the British legacy handed down to us by foreign rulers who de-vised a system tailor-made for their colony with a view to create literate, not educated men who could assist in ad-ministration. We have continued with the system without any substantial and fundamental shift in its foundation.</p>
			<p>In the Gandhian Alternative, a series analysing the Gand-hian world order in today's context, it is stated, “We have, apparently, floundered on the educational front and failed to evolve a value based education that brings out well rounded individuals as a good manager, engineer, technologist, sci-entist, worker and above all as a good human being who cares for the earth and who cares for their fellow human be-ings. The first thing to be done is to establish a solid ethical base for education as exemplified by Gandhiji; the second is to make education practice based; the third is to make it equitable and accessible to all; the fourth is to develop a network of well furnished schools all over the country; and finally to make teaching a respectable job, as it was in the olden times)”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-001-01">1</a></sup>. Mahatma Gandhi visualised an education system for free India which would achieve the integrated development of the three H’s—the hand, the head and the heart.</p>
			<p>This is where the role of a teacher comes into play. Our old educational system is based on guru-shishya parampara. In Sanskrit, ‘gu' means dark or ignorance; 'ru' means the removal of that darkness. Guru, therefore, is one who enlightens the Shishya or the one who seeks knowledge from him. He should be capable of giving his taught a glimpse of the real i.e. awakening.</p>
			<p>According to Lord Buddha, there is a lamp hidden in the personality of each one of us. We need a guide to light the lamp i.e., awakening. One may understand this to be the spiritual meaning of education. According to Dr. S. Rad-hakrishnan, education to be complete must be humane; it must include not only training of the intellect but also refine-ment of the heart and discipline of the spirit. Amore prac-tical meaning and purpose of education is given by Swami Vivekananda. According to him, education is an integrated and ideal combination of development of physique, the en-hancement of intellect and building of character. Education in its modern concept means to enable a person to earn his livelihood and at the same time shape him as a good citizen useful to the society. The latter purpose cannot be achieved unless the instructions imparted at every level whether pri-mary, secondary or university is accompanied by lessons in ethics and morality. I am confident that the system of edu-cation in this University has been so designed as to achieve that goal.</p>
			<p><strong>Excellence as a Mantra</strong></p>
			<p>Whether it is your higher studies or your career ahead, whe-ther it is a question of gaining success in your chosen career, or a question of assessing your utility in the society, you cannot reach the goal unless you adopt excellence as your Mantra. According to William Faulkner, always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.</p>
			<p>Literal meaning of the word 'excellence' is eminence or greatness or any excellent quality. On my assumption of the office of the Chief Justice of India, I declared the Year 2005 to be the Year of Excellence in Judiciary. Speaking on the Law Day i.e., 26th November 2004, I had said, Excellence consists of five I's.</p>
			<p>i) Initiative-We should not be satisfied with doing just what is our duty. Each one of us shall exert to do better than his contemporaries or predecessors doing beyond the goal of duty and to be better than himself.</p>
			<p>ii) Intelligence—None of us shall feel satisfied by medi-ocrity i.e. by just being average.</p>
			<p>iii) Industry—Each one us shall exert to put his competence and capability to its maximum utilisation.</p>
			<p>iv) Integrity</p>
			<p>v) Inobtrusive personality i.e., modesty and humility</p>
			<p>Imbibed with initiative, intelligence, industry and integrity what has been achieved is just what is the basic requirement of the personality of a judge. Such achievements should not be a reason for developing any egoistic attitude. What I had said to the judges is equally appropriate to students as well and it can be usefully adopted as my message to all of you at your convocation.</p>
			<p>When I was discussing my message of excellence with a small group of judges, one of them asked me to explain my understanding of excellence. I told them you need not compare yourself with others and compete with them. You might feel discouraged and disappointed when you see others doing far better than you. On the other hand, if you compare yourself with those who are inferior to you, you may develop an egoistic attitude. I told them that the process of achieving excellence must be confined to yourself. Today you should be a person better than what you were yesterday; and, tomorrow you should a person better than what you are today. Thus the methodology of gaining excellence consists of winning over yourself every day. It is a continuing process. They also asked me “Whether the Year of Excellence would come to an end with the close of the year 2005?”'I answered, “The journey towards excellence only begins; it never ends."</p>
			<p><strong>Have a Goal in Life</strong></p>
			<p>You don't have to take life the way it comes to you. By con-verting your dreams into goals, and your goals into plans, you can design your life to come to you the way you want it. You can live your life on purpose, instead of by chance.</p>
			<p>When we are clear about who we are and what we wish to achieve in life, when we have the blue print of ourselves sharply in focus, it becomes easier to stay at the level of character and our real self. And then, whether we like it or not, we cannot but leave a mark whatever we do, and wherever we go! A truly focussed person makes a differ-ence wherever he is, simply by being the kind of person he is. He doesn't set out to make an impression on others, or to win anyone's favour. Yet, others instinctively recognise the genuineness of character in him; anyone can easily pick out that he is dependable and trustworthy, honours his word, speaks up for the truth and assesses people for what they are truly worth, is loyal to those absent, is compassionate to the oppressed and marginalised, reaches out to the needy and befriends the lonely! He is like the corner stone which gives stability and strength to the entire structure.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-001-02">2</a></sup> These quali-ties will bring out the good in you which will be best utilised and placed at the service of the society and the nation. You will be useful. Your personality will reach a towering height.</p>
			<p><strong>Value Your Time</strong></p>
			<p>You have the capacity to take up and overcome any and every challenge in your life. God has been kind enough to give two valuable gifts to you which are most powerful weapons in your armoury. One is knowledge i.e. your edu-cation which you have been fortunate enough to receive in the portals of this great Institution, the University of Mysore. The second is your time and your capacity to make the best of use of it. Arnold Bennett writes in his book <em>How to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day—</em> "You wake up in the morning, and lo! Your purse is magically filled with twenty-four hours of the unmanufactured tissues of the universe of your life! It is yours. It is the most precious of possessions... No one can take it from you. It is unstealable. And no one receives either more or less than you.” Arnold Bennett further says, “This gift of twenty-four hours is nothing short of a mira-cle. You have to live on this twenty-four hours of daily time. Outofit you have to spin health, pleasure, money, content, respect, and the evolution of your immortal soul. Its right use, its most effective use, is a matter of the highest urgency and of the most thrilling actuality. All depends on that. Your happiness, the elusive prize that you are all clutching for, my friends, depends on that”.</p>
			<p>Omar Khayyam has beautifully captured the essence of time in the following lines:</p>
			<p class="myquote">Tomorrow's fate, though thou be wise,<br /> Thou canst not tell nor yet surmise;<br /> Pass, therefore, not today in vain,<br /> For it will never come again.</p>
			<p><strong>You Shape Your Destiny</strong></p>
			<p>Of all the living creatures man can be distinguished from animals as he is bestowed with the capacity to think, to gather and store knowledge and to sharpen his wits and in-tellect. It is how you hone these capacities and capabilities that give you an edge over others. You will be what you think yourself to be. That is why a great thinker has said: Watch your thoughts, they become your words;/ Watch your words, they become your actions;/ Watch your actions, they become your habits; Watch your habits, they become your character;/Watch your character for it will become your destiny.</p>
			<p>Aristotle said, “We are what we repeatedly do ... Men acquire a particular quality by constantly acting in a particular way—you become just by performing just actions, temper-ate by performing temperate actions, brave by performing brave actions.” I trust and hope all of you to be just, tem-perate and brave in your life by continuously performing such actions. And, though I wish you all the success in your life and in the times to come, it will not be out of place to remind you that success is another name for struggle in life. The more you exert, the more you struggle; the more you win and the more you achieve. Never get ruffled. Your phys-ical progress and mental capacity may fail if you do not have peace and tranquility. You must have faith and trust - trust in yourself and trust in God Almighty.</p>
			<p><strong>A Parting Thought</strong></p>
			<p>I am reminded of an inspiring anecdote which I am inclined to share with you.</p>
			<p>A professor began his class by holding up a glass with some water in it. He held it up for all to see and asked the students, “How much do you think this glass weighs?” “50 gm!” “100 gm!" the students answered. “I really don't know unless I weigh it," said the professor, “But my question is: what would happen if I held it up like this for a few minutes?"" “Nothing," the students said. “Ok! What would happen if I held it up like this for an hour?” the professor asked. “Your arm would begin to ache,” said one of the students. “You are right, now what would happen if I held it for a day??? “Your arm could go numb; you might have severe muscle stress and paralysis and have to go to hospital for sure!" ventured another student; and all the students laughed.</p>
			<p>“Very good. But during all this, did the weight of the glass change?" asked the professor. “No," the students said. “Then what caused the arm ache and the muscle stress?” The students were puzzled. “Put the glass down,” said one of the students. "Exactly!" said the professor. “Life's prob-lems are something like this. Hold them for a few minutes in your head and they seem okay. Think of them for a long time and they begin to ache. Hold them even longer and they begin to paralyse you. You will not be able to do anything".</p>
			<p>It is important to think of the challenges in your life, but even more important is to have trust in God and to put them down' at the end of every day before you go to sleep. That way, you are not stressed, you wake up every day fresh and strong and can handle any issue, any challenge that comes your way! Have tranquillity by putting trust in God. Tran-quillity is the sign of strong faith while worries and stress are signs of weak faith.</p>
			<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
			<p>My dear young friends! Today is your day. I am present here only for you. I would like to recite a few lines penned by the great poet Kalidasa, the essence of which, I hope, lingers in your thoughts forever and serves as an inspiration to you always.</p>
			<p class="myquote">Look to this day!<br /> For it is life, the very life of life.<br /> In its brief course<br /> Lie all the verities and realities of your existence:<br /> The bliss of growth<br /> The glory of action<br /> The splendour of achievement,<br /> For yesterday is but a dream<br /> And tomorrow is only a vision<br /> But today well lived makes very yesterday a dream of happiness<br /> And tomorrow a vision of hope<br /> Look well, therefore, to this day!<br /> Such is the salutation to the dawn.</p>

			<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">EIGHTY-SEVENTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
			<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong>PROF. C.N.R. RAO</strong><br />Honorary President<br /> Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for<br /> Advanced Scientific Research<br />Bangalore</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2007﻿</em></p>
			<p><em>Your Excellency, the Governor of Karnataka, Mr. Vice Chancellor, eminent faculty and Members of the Unviersity bodies, Members of staff and young friends,</em></p>
			<p>It is indeed a great honour to be here to deliver the Convocation Address of the year 2007.</p>
			<p>Let me straightaway touch upon the most salient point on the occasion - that is, India's future depends on her Universities. There is a need to restructure the higher education system to meet the challenges of the emerging world.</p>
			<p>The higher education system in the country is in a "bad shape" and hence it should be restructured with the introduction of new programmes with an emphasis on the interdisciplinary approach.</p>
			<p>The subject combination such as Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics (PCM) and Chemistry, Botany and Zoology (CBZ) offered in degree courses is meaningless.</p>
			<p>There is a need to offer new courses with enough flexibility to make higher education attractive to students.</p>
			<p>The country, in its anxiety to achieve progress, is ignoring higher education. Higher education is not receiving enough financial support from the Government. I have recommended along with other academics to set aside 6 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for education with at least 2 per cent for higher education at the time of framing the National Policy for Education during the tenure of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
			<p>The country is at present spending barely 3 per cent of the GDP on education with higher education accounting for very little of the amount.</p>
			<p>Over the years, the universities regarded as fountains of knowledge had become barren owing to lack of financial assistance from the government.</p>
			<p>India is the youngest country in the world with more than 60 per cent of its population below the age of 35. The rest of the world has a relatively larger number of senior citizens. In the U.S. more than 60 per cent of the population is 65 years or older. China also does not have many young people.</p>
			<p>Degeneration of the value system is highly regrettable. The ambition of most youngsters is to join a “second rate” engineering college and earn "a lot of money" before the age of 25.</p>
			<p>The domain of pure science beckons the bright students and the youngsters would do well to latch on to the new opportunities offered to achieve personal milestones and in the process they could also serve our country efficiently and meaningfully.</p>
			<p>I Wish you all the very best!</p>

			<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong> DR. G.S. SHIVARUDRAPPA</strong><br />Poet-Laureate of Karnataka</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>February 9<sup>th</sup>, 2008﻿</em></p>
			<p><em>His Excellency, the Governor of Karnataka Shri Rameshwar Thakur, the Hon'ble Vice-Chancellor of Mysore University, Professor P. Eshwar Bhat, the Hon'ble Syndicate Members, Dignitaries on the dais, dear Students who have obtained various degrees from the Mysore University, Ladies and Gentlemen.</em></p>
			<p>I deem it a great honour to have been invited as the Chief Guest for the 88th Annual Convocation of Mysore University which is my alma mater. I am deeply indebted to the Hon'ble Vice-Chancellor and the Syndicate Members for this gesture.</p>
			<p>The enthusiasm of the younger generation gathered here to receive various degrees in this function naturally takes me back to my own student days. During the fourth decade of the last century when I entered the Maharaja's college, Mysore, the Mysore University meant Maharaja's College, Mysore and Central College, Bangalore. One was dedicated to the arts faculty and the other to the science subjects. Maharaja's, especially, was a very significant cultural institution of those days. I remember with a debt of gratitude the fact that the University of Mysore provided me with an opportunity to develop my personality as I was a direct pupil of Kuvempu whose vision enveloped the entire universe though he was very much rooted in the Kannada land. That was a period which registered a second phase of resurgence after the first phase of renaissance illuminated by such redoubtable savants like Acharya B.M. Sri, Professor T.S. Venkannaiah, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Professor N.S. Subbarao, Professor A.R: Wadia and others. The illustrious contemporaries of Kuvempu include Professor D.L. Narasimhachar, who was known as the walking encyclopaedia; Professor Ti. Nam.Srikantaiah, who was an ideal mixture of creativity and scholarship; Professor T.S. Shamarao, who was an embodiment of compassion - they all contributed for the glory of Maharaja's College.</p>
			<p>At the same time teachers belonging to different faculties at Maharaja's College like Professor V.L. D'Souza, Professor T.A. Purushottam, Professor M. Yamunacharya, Professor S.V. Ranganna and Professor M.V. Gopalaswamy turned out to be our beacon lights. The excitement and the lively atmosphere; the warm relationship between the teachers and students; the stature and expertise attained by the teachers in the domains of literaturearts-scholarship-history-philosophy and the respect and honour they had gained, as a result, have become a rarity at present. during the first phase of Mysore University, to which I referred a while ago, the most eminent Philosopher of India, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan left Maharaja's College to join Calcutta University as Professor of Philosophy. Recording those moments very vividly elsewhere, Professor A.N. Murthy Rao describes the manner in which the students of Maharaja's College drew the coach themselves till the railway station. “No emperor could have commanded such a farewell which was given to Dr. S Radhakrishnan at that time”, says A.N. Murthy Rao. This is a symbol of the <em>guru-shishya</em> relationship.</p>
			<p>The Mysore University is one of the oldest Universities in India. It became an independent University in 1916 due to the philanthropic and far-sighted efforts of both the Maharaja of Mysore, Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar and his trusted Dewan Sir M. Visveswaraya. Until then it was a part of Madras University. In the first Convocation Address in 1918, the Maharaja Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar emphasized that Kannada should have a pride of place in the Mysore University and he further underlined the fact that all the youth emerging from the university holding degrees must be capable of enlightening the people of the surrounding areas through Kannada Language. The advice given by the Maharaja in his first Convocation Address has clearly indicated two very important tasks: the place of Kannada in our educational scheme and the social responsibility of the educated people. I feel it is pertinent to recall the words of Kuvempu when he spoke at the time of receiving the Honoris Causa Degree from Karnataka University in 1966. Kuvempu said thus: “Our democratic constitution has recognized legally the regional identity in its very purpose of dividing the state linguistically. And hence the universities situated in different regions must necessarily promote literature, arts and culture of their respective regions. Because if the universities of the region fail to undertake such a task no other institution of the world would do so”, (Complete Prose Works: Vol. 2, p362). These words of Kuvempu clearly define the role of the universities in safeguarding and nurturing the culture of a given region. But of late there is a strong tendency to ignore the multi-cultural and regional aspect of our universities in the new-fangled enthusiasm to impose a monolithic framework on them. There is an inbuilt danger in this move, in the sense, that this emphasis on uniform system which demands uniformity in syllabi and in examination pattern would take away creativity in teaching-learning process converting the system into a lifeless military regimentation. In this background, it is not surprising to learn that our educationists have not been seriously exercised on the issues pertaining to the role of regional languages in education and the social responsibility of the educated people to safeguard the regional dimension of culture.</p>
			<p>Even after fifty years of the emergence of State of Karnataka after linguistic reorganization; because of lack of a definite Language Policy and 'Non-implementation of the Language Scheme the issue of language has remained a complex problem of our times. It is well-known that there is a correlation between the language and culture of a community and the geographical territory that contours the people. Though Kannada is not the mother tongue of all in Karnataka, it is undoubtedly the first language obtained in the environment. Ours is the community conceived in Kannada. And hence it is very imperative that administration, education and creation of knowledge must be in Kannada. Further, it is equally imperative that Kannada language must be equipped in such a way that the knowledge of the world is made available in Kannada. It is an astonishing fact that neither the political leaders nor the people who elect them are recognizing the necessity of a political will in this regard.</p>
			<p>At the time of this Annual Convocation, first of all, I would like to congratulate the students who are obtaining various degrees in different disciplines. Some of you may choose to pursue higher education and a majority of you may opt for opportunities being made possible by the existing set-up. But this much is true; that is, though you have earned degrees specializing in various subjects you must understand that this definitely is not the end of your learning; instead, it actually is, your beginning. The complex and conspiratorial real world is the university that stretches in front of you hereafter. There is nothing worthwhile than keeping an alert mind ever-oriented in the direction of knowledge. As Buddha said “You are your own beacon lights'.</p>
			<p>Friends, the contemporary world of India where you and I live, is a world where the human relationship has disintegrated; a world that is polluted by environmental degradation; a world that converts everything into market commodity and weighs in the balance; a world where religions manifest suddenly as barriers instead of bringing people together; a world that is corrupted though there has been a long tradition of great thoughts which could enlighten the entire mankind; a world which clings tenaciously to superstitions and irrationality in the midst of extraordinary leaps in the realm of science and technology; a world where there is a constant exploitation of the oppressed communities by the dominant segment of society negating the aspirations of the Constitution; a world that has traversed very far in relentless pursuit of violence away from Mahatma Gandhi's dream of the advancement of all. Some of these anxieties necessitate expansion. In the name of development we have been experiencing the daunting threat of environmental destruction. After India attained Independence Gandhi dreamt of villagecentred development schemes; but what occupied the centre stage was the western-oriented technology. As a result, though there is a sense of progress on the surface, in actuality, a tremendous damage has been done on our environment and the culture that depends on the forest. It is a tragic fall-out that man has begun to look upon nature as a thing earmarked for his consumption instead of strengthening his relationship with it as an object of worship. Gandhi said “This earth can satisfy everyone's need and not everyone's greed”. But today, in the name of science man is looting the treasure of the earth in utter greed. The mining that is taking place all over the country, officially and illegally, is nothing but an assault on nature. The nature that was intensely loved by our poets, artists and the common people is just reduced to a marketable commodity. Therefore the food we eat the water we drink and the air we breathe—all have become polluted. We have forgotten the truth that to love nature is a very significant value in itself. We have to teach our children that to love nature is just an extension of loving life. Because how can one love human beings if he is incapable of loving a bird, a tree, a standing mountain and a flowing river ? The great challenge before us is to harmonize nature conservation and development at a time when there is an unstoppable and merciless aggression on nature. One needs to contemplate very seriously on these matters.</p>
			<p>The scientific awareness man could command in the last two centuries was not available at any other period of human history. Though India has made unimagined progress in the field of Science and Technology, the mind of India has not evolved in the direction of scientific temper which is the backbone of rationality. Instead, it has leaned heavily towards superstitions, both old and new. No progress can be made in anything if we are still bothered by the traditional horoscope. It is another paradox that science, instead of playing an ameliorative role, is actually being used as a weapon of violence. Medical Science is engaged in enhancing longevity through life-saving researches on the one hand and the governments are spending enormous amount of money on forging new weapons of mass destruction, on the other. The magnitude of violence seen in the 20th century is unprecedented. Buddha and war have always stared at humanity as symbols of peace and violence. One can easily discern to which side the pendulum of history swings. As the human beings progress in civilization there has been a change in the alibi they find for war and the instruments they employ to fight; but the mind that guides them has not changed much.</p>
			<p>It is a matter of great curiosity to find out how creativity and thinking of our country react to the anxieties that are bred in an environment of violence that is a continuation of our history. Importantly, in the last two decades, this world, including the virtuous land that is India, is subjected to inhuman conflict and violence by terrorists. This country has safeguarded religious harmony since centuries by some life-sustaining mechanism; and that is threatened today by the unholy nexus between the so called religion and politics. We are witnessing the disintegration in a helpless manner. Swami Vivekananda said "Religion is Manmaking”. But what has happened to today's man? Today's man has become stagnant in the rigid conventions. He is caught in the barbed wire of meaningless rituals; he is divided due to his religious and sectarian affiliations. The question that looms large is how to establish a man on the basis of unhoused consciousness beyond constricting structures. It is unfortunate that our collective consciousness readily reacts to matters such as social inequality, exploitation and corruption; but in the case of communal violence engendered by sectarian considerations, our reaction is marked by diffidence reflecting a more subtle politics. But amidst this gloomy prospect it is heartening to note that there are individuals who can see through the subterfuges of violence, capable of unmasking their debilitating politics. Such minds are alert and they are interpreting history in a healthy way. This is a source of great solace.</p>
			<p>Our education which is expected to play a major role in personality building has lost its dreams which were part of its programme. Education ought to support our life and at the same time it must develop our inner being as well. That objective has receded into background and everything is swallowed by the vortex of money-making activity. In the gleeful dance of information technology pitched in the forefront in the present neocolonial context, Engineering, Medicine, Biotechnology and Computer Science and such like subjects have acquired great importance. That too the education that leads to jobs fetching fat salaries in the multinational companies is considered to be the real education and those who acquire such an education are deemed to be the real cream of society. This illusion, unfortunately, is catching up. In this context Arts, Pure Science, Social Sciences and Humanities have been totally neglected. How can anyone visualize the emergence of real scientists, poets and artists in such a scenario? It appears that this problem cannot be solved until we reduce the gap between incomes of people pursuing different vocations. Especially, jobs that require physical labour ensure neither dignity nor income. Likewise, there seems to be no relief from this capital based culture as long as there is a commercial system that runs solely on the twin engines of capital and skill.</p>
			<p>Different media which are expected to play a creative role in organizing people's lives are caught in the quagmire of commercial culture. Thus, art merely becomes an interlude between advertisements. It appears as if majorities of our media give prominence to sensational news and ignore the matters which are significant culturally. Especially, most of the visual media spend a good portion of their time for the broadcast of entertainment. They use women as commodity and hence it is nothing but an attack on the dignity of women.</p>
			<p>Through these media unseemly cultures of other countries dominate the airwaves and in the process destroy our native culture; this is detrimental to our creativity and rationality. These are really powerful media which could become a potent weapon of social change, if wielded, by the thinking people; but they have been cornered by not so sensitive individuals who sell cheap entertainment as a staple diet.</p>
			<p>There is an absolute dearth of stalwarts in India today who could guide the nation on a proper path. The present politics which is expected to lead the people of younger generation properly is utterly incapable of drawing our attention to a valuebased life. It is really astonishing to note how a majority of our governments are unreasonably eager to invite multinational companies into our midst. The neo-colonial centres of globalization have cornered seventy percent of commerce and have created a situation where about half of the world's population must live below the poverty line. The attempt to convert agrobased Indian society into a technological society has pushed lakhs of peasants to commit suicide. In the last six-seven years alone some thirty thousand farmers have committed suicide. Corruption that has engulfed the nation has unnerved everyone who cares for the well-being of this country. What is more puzzling is the people of India have silently accepted corruption as a part of their life without any embarrassment.</p>
			<p>My dear young friends, so far I have just shared with you my reactions to some of the anxieties of our contemporary world without resorting to any didactic mode of utterance. While speaking thus, I have not forgotten the fact that we too are a part of this angst-ridden world. Because, the artists, thinkers and activists of all ages have aspired for a world which is more beautiful, more happy and well-rounded in terms of rational thinking. But unless we change, the world that is rotten according to our present perception, will not change. Without effecting a change in ourselves first, it is utterly unethical to expect the world to change. Because, I firmly believe that some change is possible if only we are bothered seriously by a guilt feeling that we too are responsible for the present state of affairs in the country.</p>

			<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">EIGHTY-NINTH CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
			<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong> PROF. SUKADEO THORAT</strong><br /><em>Chairman<br /> University Grants Commission, New Delhi</em></p>
			<p class="text-center"><em><strong>March 7, 2009﻿</strong></em></p>
			<p><em>Hon'ble Shri Rameshwar Thakur Ji, Chancellor and Governor of Karnataka; Shri Aravinda Limbavali, Minister, Higher Education, Government of Karnataka;, Prof. V.G. Talawar, Vice Chancellor, Members of the Syndicate and Academic Council; faculty members; honoured guests; representatives of press and electronic media; dear students, ladies and gentlemen.</em></p>
			<p>I deem it a privilege to address the 89th Convocation of the University of Mysore, Mysore. This occasion becomes all the more special, as the University will be conferring the Degree of <em>Honoris Causa</em> (D.Litt) to five eminent personalities, Shri K.G. Balakrishnan, Chief Justice, Supreme Court of India, Prof. GK. Chadha, Member, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, Prof. B. Sheik Ali, former Vice-Chancellor, Mangalore &#38; Goa Universities, Dr. R.K. Sinha, Director, Reactor Design and Development Group, Bhabha Automic Research Centre, Mumbai &#38; Smt. S. Janaki, the Play-back singer in South Indian Film Industry, who have made notable contributions in their respective fields not only in India but globally.</p>
			<p>I would also take the opportunity to convey my hearty congratulations to the Gold Medalists and Cash Prize Winners and all the students on successful completion of their academic programmes and attaining degrees and distinctions in their respective fields.</p>
			<p>As the government has finalized the approach and strategy for higher education during the 11th Plan and put it into operation through necessary financial allocation, I would like to present the main issues that the 11th Plan has addressed and the approach, strategy and action plan as proposed by the Government.</p>
			<p><strong>Progress in Institutional Capacity</strong></p>
			<p>I would like to first begin with the review of the progress of higher education in the country. The level of higher education is determined by the size of institutional capacity of higher education system in the country. The size of higher education system, in turn, is determined mainly by three indicators, namely, number of educational institutions—universities and colleges, number of teachers and number of students.</p>
			<p>The higher education in India has witnessed many-fold increase in its institutional capacity since Independence. During 1950 and 2008, the number of universities has increased from 20 to about 431, colleges from 500 to 20,677 and the teachers from 15,000 to nearly 5.05 lakh. Consequently, the enrolment of students has increased from a mere 1.00 lakh in 1950 to over 116.12 lakh.</p>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Aggregate Enrolment Rate</strong></p>
			<p>The expansion in institutional capacity in terms of number of universities/colleges and teachers has provided greater access to the students to post higher secondary education.</p>
			<p>The Access to higher education is measured in terms of Gross Enrolment Ratio, (GER) which is a ratio of persons enrolled in higher education institutions to total population of the persons in the age group of 18 to 23 years. The estimate of GER is generally based on the data collected by MHRD/UGC from the educational institutions. However, the studies in this volume for the first time also estimated the GER based on National Sample Survey (NSS) data and population Census data. The estimate based on SES indicates that the access to higher education measured in term of gross enrolment ratio increased from 0.7% in 1950-51 to 1.4% in 1960-61. By 2006-07 the GER increased to about 11 percent.</p>
			<p>The GER based on NSS data for 2004-5 is on higher side that is 12.59%(10.84% for graduate and 1.75% for diploma). The GER is also on higher side based on population census data for 2001, that is, 13.6%.</p>
			<p>The studies in this volume bring out the obvious differences in enrolment rate between SES and NSS/ population Censes. The NSS being household survey covers all public and private institutions as well as distance education and also include certificate and diploma holders. The SES has generally remained confined to graduate and above in public institutions and private aided institutions. Besides, it suffers from underreporting by the states and universities. The difference between the two sources is about 2 percentage points. The population census estimate is also based on household survey and thus includes all institutions. Besides the graduate and above, population census data also include certificate and diploma holders.</p>
			<p><strong>Inter-Regional disparities in Enrolment rate</strong></p>
			<p>While the enrolment rate at aggregate level is about 11% in 2006-7 at overall level, it varies significantly across the states and districts. The studies in this volume bring out the regional disparities in the enrolment rate.</p>
			<p>The estimate separately worked by Ravi Srivastva and Amresh Dubey based on the NSS for 2004-5 (NSS Employment and Unemployment Survey, 61th Round, 2004-5) data bring out variation across the states. As against the 11% of all India average, the GER is lower in states of Aunachal Pradesh, Bihar, M.P., Meghalaya, Mizoram, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura and Jharkahnd.</p>
			<p>There are a large number of districts which have lower GER. It needs to be mentioned that in 10th Plan educationally backward districts were identified on the basis of literacy rate. It was felt that for identifying the educationally backward districts in higher education, instead of literacy rate, the gross enrolment rate will be abetter indicator. Therefore the educationally backward districts were identified based on the gross enrolment ratio. The estimate made by S. Sinha based on the population Census data for 2001 revealed that out of 584 total districts about 373 districts had GER lower than national average. Of the total educationally backward districts about 3% had GER less than 3%. About 21% had GER which vary between 3% to 6%. Another 38% had GER between 6% to 9% and the remaining 37% had GER between 9% to 12%.</p>
			<p><strong>Issues Related to Expansion of Enrolment Rate and Strategy proposed in 11th Plan</strong></p>
			<p>The 11th Plan recognized the dual problem of higher education, namely of low enrolment rate and the regional imbalance. It recognized that the 11% enrolment rate is too low compared to 23% of world average or 36.5% for countries in transitions or more than 55% for developed countries. Development experience of the developed countries indicates that sustained economic growth requires minimum of 20% to 25% enrolment in higher education.</p>
			<p>With this realization the 11th plan aims to increase the GER to 21% by the end of Twelfth plan with an interim target of 15% by 2012.</p>
			<p>Besides, the plan also recognized that the additional increase in enrolment necessarily will have to come from those regions where the enrolment is relatively low. Thus reduction of inter-regional disparities is a part the overall strategy of increasing the enrolment rate up to 15% in 11 th Plan and further up to 21% by the end of 2012.</p>
			<p>To realize the target of 15%, the enrolment will have to be raised at much higher per annum rate. Duraiswamy worked out the required increase in enrolment to achieve the target of 15% GER by the end of 11th plan. It indicated that the 15% target would require us to increase the total enrolments at per annum rate of 8.9% (as against only 4.5% during the 10th Plan). In absolute number it would mean net increase of about 7 million students by 2012.</p>
			<p>Thus the 15% target envisages an increase in enrolment from 14 million in 2006-7 to 21 million by the year 2021 with net increase of 7 millions. In terms of annual growth rate, as mentioned above, this net increase would amount to 8.9 per cent increase on per annum basis.</p>
			<p>During the 10th Five Year Plan, enrolment is estimated to have increased from 9.5 million during 2002-03 to 14 million during 2006-07; that is, a, net increase of 4.5 million at a per annum rate of about 4.5 per cent. The targeted increase of 7 million during the 11th Five Year Plan would thus, require a much larger expansion in the capacity of educational institutions in the realm of higher education.</p>
			<p>It is equally necessary to recognize that achieving a 5 per cent net target is indeed ambitious' one. Considering that we have been able to increase the GER by 10 percentage points in the last fifty-five years (that is from 1 per cent in 1950 to 10 per cent in 2006-07); the achievement of the targeted increase by 5 per cent net in the 11th Five Year Plan (half of what has been achieved in the last fifty-five years) seems to be a determined proposition. Hence it requires a matching expansion in the capacity of educational institutions.</p>
			<p>The 11th Five Year Plan proposed a dual strategy to increase the institutional capacity to achieve the target of 15% by 2012.</p>
			<p>The first component of the strategy involves additional increase in the numbers of universities, colleges, and vocational and technical institutions.</p>
			<p>Second component of the strategy centered on enhancing the "intake capacity of existing educational institutions.</p>
			<p>The 11th plan recognized the need of additional education institutions. The 11th Plan thus proposed the following steps to increase the new institutions.</p>
			<p>a) 30 new Central Universities, under the initiative of the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, have been proposed. It also includes setting up of 30 medical and engineering colleges in Central Universities. In addition a Tribal University is also to be set up.</p>
			<p>b) On technical education side 8 new IITs, 20 NITS, 20 IIITs, 3 IISERs, 7 IIMs, and 2 SPAs have been proposed.</p>
			<p>c) Again on the initiative of Prime Minister 373 new colleges in districts with less than all India GERs with Central assistance on a matching basis from the States have been proposed; and</p>
			<p>d) New Polytechnics in un-served districts, 500 new community Polytechnics, and 210 new community colleges have been proposed.</p>
			<p>Second strategy envisages expanding of intake capacity of existing institutions - both government and private and covers Central and State Universities, colleges, and other education institutions. An essential part of this strategy incorporates a substantial increase in the regular development grants to Central and State Universities and colleges.</p>
			<p>Besides, other provisions include disbursement of special grants to Central Universities and other Central institutions (like . the IIMs, the IITs, the NIITs, medical, and engineering institutions) for increase in their intake capacities by about 54 per cent under the stipulations of the Oversight Committee.</p>
			<p><strong>Expansion through Increased Access in Low Enrolment Regions</strong></p>
			<p>The estimates worked out by Sudhanshu Bhushan, Ravi Srivastva and S. Sinha brings out considerable disparities in the enrolment between states and districts. Therefore at uniform growth rate of enrolment Sudhanshu Bhushan has estimated as to how different States would perform. His estimate indicates that, among major states, Bihar, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam have GER of less than 10% in 2005. These states are likely to achieve enrolment target of less than 10% in 2012. There are states such as Rajasthan, J&#38;K, W&#38;B, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh, UP, Kerala, Orissa and Harayana which are likely to achieve GER in the range of 10% to 15% in 2012. The remaining states will have achieved GER of more than 15%. The enrolment target, addition enrolment and GER for the states are based on certain assumption relating to population and GER.</p>
			<p>11th Plan thus provides a particular focus on reducing the regional imbalance in the enrolment rate. The policy focuses on educationally backward districts; hilly, border, and tribal areas; remote locations, minority concentration districts; and rural areas. The universities and colleges located in these low enrolment districts will receive an additional financial support. This special initiative will also help to enhance the intake capacity of existing universities and colleges.</p>
			<p><strong>Issues Related to Inclusiveness and Equal Access</strong></p>
			<p>The studies in this volume observed that although the enrolment rate in higher education is about 11%, there are significant inter-group disparities in access to higher education. Ravi Srivastva and Amaresh Dubey based on the NSS data for the first time estimated the gross enrolment rate for various groups and bring out the variation in enrolment rate in 2004-5, between male-female, between SC, ST, OBC and other, between religious groups, economic groups such as self-employed and wage labourer, between income groups (in term of per capita consumption expenditure) and poor and non-poor. The malefemale disparities are examined in greater detail by Saraswati Raju in her paper. Put together these studies provide good insight into inter-group differences in access to higher education in Indian society.</p>
			<p>The NSS data for 2004-05 (latest year for which the NSS data are available) indicates significant rural and urban disparitiesenrolment rate being 6.73 percent and 19.80 per cent for the rural and the urban areas respectively - the GER in the urban areas being three times higher compared to rural areas.</p>
			<p>However, inter-caste/tribe disparities are the most prominent. In 2004-05, the GER was about 11 per cent at overall levels. The GER among the SCs (6.30 per cent), the STs (6.33 per cent), and the OBCs (8.50 per cent) was much lower compared with the Others (16.60 per cent). Thus, the GER for the SC/STs was three times and that of the OBCs about two times less compared with the Others. Between the SC/STs and the OBCs, however, the GER was lower among the former by about two percentage points.</p>
			<p>There is another feature about access to higher education, which the studies bring out quite clearly. The access to these social groups varies within the respective religion to which they belong. Therefore, the SCs, the STs, and the OBCs suffer unequally as religious group. For instance, in 2004-05, the GER of the OBC Muslims was 6 per cent as compared with 7.34 per cent for Non-OBC Muslims. Similar disparities are apparent in the case of SC and the Non-SC/ST Christians. In the case of the SC Sikhs, the GER was only 2 per cent compared with 15 per cent among Non-SC Sikhs. Similarly, the GER of tribal Christians was 6.48 per cent compared to 23.29 per cent for Non-SC/ST Christians.</p>
			<p>It is, thus, evident that the SCs, the STs, and the OBCs from all religions suffer from lower access to higher education. However, the SCs within the Hindu and the Sikh suffer more acutely than the SCs belonging to other religions. Similarly, the OBCs within the Muslims probably suffer more than the Hindu OBCs. Similarly, the STs within the Hindu fold suffer more than their Christian counterparts.</p>
			<p>In 2004-05, disparities are also evident in enrolment rate between religious groups. The GER for the Hindus, the Muslims, the Christians, the Sikhs, and the Others stood at 11.9, 6.84, 16.68, about 12, and 15.4 percentage points respectively. Thus, the GER was the lowest among the Muslims followed by the Hindus.</p>
			<p>Also, there are wide gender disparities in terms of access to higher education. Access is generally lower for girls as compared to the boys - the GER being 12.42 per cent for the males and 9.11 per cent for the females. It needs to be recognized that although the enrolment rate is generally lower for the females compared to the males, the females belonging to the lower castes and some religious groups suffer more acutely in accessing higher education than other female. For instance, in 2004-05, as against the overall average of 9.11 per cent, GER among the females was 4.76%, 4.43%, 6.60%, and 19.53% points respectively for the ST, the SC, the OBC, and the other females. Thus, the GER among the ST/SC females was about five times and that of the OBC females about three times less compared to the higher caste females.</p>
			<p>In the case of religious groups, the Muslim women seem to be facing the most difficult circumstance. The GER among Muslim females was 5.8 per cent compared to 932 per cent for Hindu females, 12.7 per cent for Sikh females, and 16 per cent for Christian females.</p>
			<p>Lastly, there are perceivable differences in enrolment rates among the poor and non-poor (irrespective of their caste, ethnic, religious, or gender backgrounds). The GER for the poor was 2.21 per cent as against 12.36 per cent for the non-poor, therefore, the GER for the poor was almost twelve times lower compared with the non-poor. In the rural and the urban areas, the GER for the poor stood at 1.40 per cent and 4 per cent respectively, which was evidently quite low compared with 7.12 per cent and 27.15 per cent for non-poor respectively.</p>
			<p>Within the poor households, however, the GER was the lowest among the poor households belonging to the STs and the SCs, followed by the OBCs and the others. The GER for poor belonging to the STs and the SCs, the OBCs, and others stood at 1.55%, 1.89%, 2.30% and 3.58% respectively. In the rural areas, the GER was the lowest among the STs at a marginal level of 1.11 per cent followed by the SCs at 1.35 per cent, the OBCs at 1.13 per cent, and the others at 1.66 per cent - the overall GER being 1.30 per cent.</p>
			<p>In the urban areas, the GER for the urban poor stood at 3.86, 4.78, 5.16, and 7 percentage points respectively for the SCs, the STs, the OBCs, and the others - the average being 5.51 per cent.</p>
			<p>Differences in the GER are also equally evident across occupational groups in the rural and the urban areas. The GER was 3 per cent for non-farm wage labourers and 1.41 per cent for farm wage labourers. Similarly, in the urban areas, the GER was only 3.26 per cent for casual labourers. Thus, both in the rural and the urban areas, the enrolment rates for wage (casual) labourers were the lowest, particularly, for the farm wage labourers.</p>
			<p>For the wage labourers, the GER was particularly low amongst the SC/STs compared with the others. For instance, as against 1.41 per cent at overall level for the wage labourers in the rural areas; the ratio was 0.67.1.63, 1.16, and 1.93 percentage points for the ST, the SCs, the OBC, and the other wage labourers respectively. Similarly, in the urban areas, the GER for casual labourers was 3.26 per cent at overall level as against 1.53%, 2.16%, 3.34%, and 4.30% for the ST, the SC, the OBC, and other wage labourers respectively.</p>
			<p>In other words, although the enrolment rates are the lowest among the poor, casual wage labourer households in the rural and the urban areas, the rate are particularly low among the poor from the same group, and belonging to the SC/ST/OBCs. The enrolment rates for the ST, the SC, and the OBC agricultural labourers stood at 0.9%, 0.01%, and 0.93% respectively. Similarly, the enrolment rates for the casual non-farm wage labourers in the rural areas stood at nil for the STs and the SCs and 0.52 per cent for the OBCs. In the urban areas, the enrolment rates for the poor casual labourers work out to 0.66 per cent for the STs, 2.61 per cent for the SCs, and 3.92 per cent for the OBCs.</p>
			<p>The 11th Five Year Plan recognized the problem of multiple natures of disparities in enrolment rate and proposed policy measures to enhance their access to higher education. It brought the inclusiveness in higher education at the centre of our higher education policy. Inclusive education essentially requires an increased access to higher education to these multiple groups who suffer from lower access to higher education. The approach and strategy thus, formulate policies and schemes for the STs, the SCs, the OBCs, girls, minorities particularly the Muslims, physically challenged persons, semi-nomadic and de-notified and the poor.</p>
			<p><strong>Inclusive Education Policies</strong></p>
			<p>The 11th Plan proposed number of measures for inclusive education.</p>
			<p>Firstly, the Plan proposes to support universities and colleges located in 373 districts having lower GER and also envisages to open new colleges in these districts with matching contributions from the States.</p>
			<p>Secondly, it proposes special support to universities and colleges located in rural, hilly, remote, tribal, and border areas. Further, about 90 districts concentrated with Muslim population have been identified for central support.</p>
			<p>Thirdly, the Plan also proposes an enhanced support to universities and colleges with a high concentration of the students belonging to SC/ST/OBCs, and Muslim population.</p>
			<p>Fourthly, the plan focused on developing schemes to improve language and competency through remedial coaching classes. Besides, the Plan specifically emphasizes on augmenting fellowship and opening up of hostels, particularly for women to enhance their access to higher education.</p>
			<p>Further, opening up of new Polytechnics in un-served districts, 500 new community Polytechnics, new 210 Community Colleges, and various other programmes of the UGC in the ongoing schemes will help to include the excluded social groups.</p>
			<p>The setting up of 30 Central Universities has a strong component of inclusiveness in so far as it will offer affordable access with due share to the SC/ST, and OBCs.</p>
			<p>An important aspect of inclusiveness is affordability. Without affordability, it is not possible to increase access and promote inclusiveness. Thus, affordability will have to be ensured through special measures. The 11th Five Year Plan makes provision for the disbursement of scholarships for 2 per cent of the total students along with Education Loan Interest Subsidy through Higher Education Loan Guarantee Authority. Further, there are provisions for research fellowships for NET and nonNET qualified Ph.D. students.</p>
			<p>Above all the 11th Plan had developed a scheme under which a separate Cell, “Equal Opportunity Office” will be set up in the universities to operate all schemes for SC/ST, OBCs, Girls, Minority student, physically challenge students, semi-nomadic and de-notified and other weaker section students under one umbrella office.</p>
			<p><strong>Status of Quality and Excellence</strong></p>
			<p>The third issue that the studies in this volume addressed relates to the issue of quality of higher education system. What is the status of university and college education with respect to quality and excellence?</p>
			<p>The UGC drew a distinction between quality and excellence and used separate indicators to judge and promote quality and excellence through grant-giving mechanism. The UGC provides grants to those universities and colleges, which meet minimum standard.</p>
			<p>For recognizing and promoting excellence UGC developed the concept of university with potential for excellence, college with potential for excellence, department/center with potential for excellence. It also included concept of Autonomous Colleges.</p>
			<p>Besides, National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) constantly involved in quality assessment of universities/ colleges and grade them.</p>
			<p>What is the status of quality? By March 2008, there were about 20,676 colleges in the country, of which about 16,000 come under UGC's purview. This accounts for about 80 per cent of the total colleges in the country. Of the total colleges under the purview of the UGC, about 40 per cent or 5,813 receive UGC grants as they meet the minimum standards defined by the UGC.</p>
			<p>What is the status of excellence? Currently the UGC has recognized about 9 universities with potential of excellence, 100 colleges with potential of excellence, about 250 colleges are recognized as autonomous colleges and about 500 department/ centre are recognized as centres of excellence.</p>
			<p>As mentioned above, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council is also involved in the assessment of quality and accreditation of the universities and colleges. In 2006, about 3,411 colleges had been accredited by the NAAC - equivalent to about 57 per cent of the colleges covered under the UGC  grants (that is, 5,813). This accounts for about 24 per cent ofthe total colleges (that is, 16,000), which fall under the purview of the UGC.</p>
			<p>As on date there are about 417 Universities - of these about 140 have been assessed and accredited by the NAAC. Ofthese, 140 sample universities, 31 per cent were graded ‘A’, 61 per cent were graded ‘B’ and 7 per cent were graded ‘C’ in that order. (table 6(a))</p>
			<p>It is important to note that ofthe total colleges accredited  by the NAAC till date (that is, 3,492) about 9 per cent were graded ‘A’, 68 per cent were graded ‘B’, and the remaining 23 per cent were graded ‘C’. Therefore, the bulk ofthem or about 68 per cent, were graded either ‘B’ or ‘C’. (table 6 (b)</p>
			<p>What are the reasons for inter-university and inter-college  variations in quality ofeducation? Furcian Quamar and S. Sinha have examined the reasons for the inter-institution variations in quality in the studies sponsored by UGC.</p>
			<p>Analysis of about 1 1 1 Universities and 3 ,492 colleges assessed by the NAAC indicates that the deficiencies in availability ofhuman resources in terms ofquantity and quality teachers and physical and other infiastructural facilities caused qualitative gaps between ‘A’ and ‘C’ grade universities and colleges. (see table 5 (a) and 5 (b).</p>
			<p>The percentage ofcolleges with libraries, computer centres, health centres, sport facilities, hostels, guest houses, teachers’ housing, canteens, common rooms, welfare schemes,gymnasiums, auditoriums. and seminar rooms are much higher in case of high quality colleges as compared with the low quality ones.</p>
			<p>Similarly, high quality colleges are better placed with regard  to academic indicators, which include higher student-teacher ratios. number of permanent teachers or teachers with PhD. degrees, books per student, books and journals per college, and students per computers etc. Thus, if 36 per cent of low quality colleges are to be brought at parity with high quality ones, a substantial improvement in the physical and academic infrastructure is necessary.</p>
			<p>In case ofuniversities, those graded ‘A’ generally perform better with respect to a number of indicators, which include number ofdepartments, number offaculties with PhD. degrees. number offaculty members per department, and number ofbooks in the libraries, etc</p>
			<p><strong>Policy for promotion of Quality and Excellence</strong></p>
			<p>The 11th plan recognized the issue ofquality. It has brought a sharp focus on the promotion ofquality and excellence. The Plan recognizes that quality in higher education is critically incumbent on a) physical infiastrucmre, b) number and quality of teachers, and c) academicigovemance in universities and colleges.</p>
			<p>The 11th Five Year Plan includes a number ofinitiatives. These include firstly, improvement in physical infiastructural facilities; availability ofadequate and quality faculty, andAcademic Reforms with respect to Admission, teaching and Examination and other academic aspects.</p>
			<p><strong>Physical Infrastructure</strong></p>
			<p>The policy for improving physical infrastructure includes increase in general development grants on existing schemes by substantial margin. This will induce a substantial improvement in the infrastructure.</p> 
			<p>The policy for improving physical infrastructure includes increase in general development grants on existing schemes by substantial margin. This will induce a substantial improvement in the infrastructure.</p> 
			<p>The studies indicate that C-grade universities and colleges - essentially lack in number ofessential physical infrastructure. Therefore, a schemes is proposed to provide financial assistance to the C-grade universities and colleges to improve their infrastructure under the ‘Bridging Quality Gap Scheme’.</p> 
			<p>The second issue relates to problem ofthe State universities and colleges, which at present are not covered under the UGC grants. The 11th Plan proposed a scheme namely, “Covering Un-covered Universities and Colleges.” Under this scheme the uncovered colleges and universities will be provided one-time grants to improve their physical and human resource infiasu'ucuire to a level whereby they become eligible for UGC grants.</p> 
			<p>Both the schemes involve provision ofone-time central  assistance on matching contribution from the respective government in the case of State Universities and Central Universities, and from the management ofthe college, in case of colleges. </p>
			<p><strong>Faculty Improvement</strong></p>
			<p>The 11th Plan recogniied that the availability ofadequate and qualified faculty is a prerequisite for quality education. It also recognized that due to restrictions on the recruitment ofthe faculty in the State Universities and Colleges in 1980’s and 1990’s by various states, we face a serious problem related to the availability ofthe facility. Due to restrictions on recruitment, the universities and colleges have resorted to temporary and adhoc faculty. We don’t have reliable data on the magnitude of the temporary faculty in colleges and universities. The sample data collected by UGC indicate that about one-third ofuniversities faculty is ad hoe/temporary and on contract.</p>
			<p>The study done by Pay Review Committee (PRC), by GK. Chadha, Sudhanshu Bhushan and Murlidhar based on sample of47 universities from 19 states, and 1401 colleges bring out the situation about the faculty.</p>
			<p>The State Universities show a very depressing scenario, for all positions; the overall level ofvacant positions is 58 per cent, and it is much higher at the level ofLecturers and Readers. In as much as around 90%ofstudents in university departments are enrolled in State Universities, such a high incidence ofvacant positions is sure to be making a damaging effect on the quantity as well as quality ofteaching and research in universities in general and State Universities in particular observed the PRC study. Among the Deemed Universities, nearly one-third ofvacancies are lying unfilled.</p>
			<p>The situation is equally, ifnot more, gn'm for colleges (Table 6 (b). No fewer than 41.0 per cent ofpositions at the Lecturerlevel, and 18.0 per cent ofthose at the Reader-level, are lying unfilled. The situation in non-aided colleges is far more distressing, in this regard. As many as 52.0 per cent ofvacancies at the entry level and 42.0 per cent ofvacancies at the level of Readers are lying unfilled. Nearly 42.0 per cent ofentry-level positions are vacant in govemment colleges against 40.0 per cent in govemment aided colleges, while, the corresponding figures for the Readerlevel positions are 19.0 per cent, respectively.</p>
			<p>Shortage ofteachers has led to employment ofpart time or <em>ad hoc</em>teachers. The ratio ofpart time lecturers to regular ‘ lecturers is 0.24, for all types ofuniversities put together; 0.32 for state, and 0.20 for Deemed Universities. In State Universities, there is one part-time or adhoc teacher for every other regular lecturer, and one such lecturer for every five regular lecturers in Deemed Universities. Likewise, in colleges, out of 100 lecturers, there were 3 8 part-time/contract lecturers. in the govemmentaided colleges, the incidence ofcontract lecturers was the highest.</p>
			<p><strong>The Pay Review Committee Report observed</strong></p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>“that the overall situation is rather alarming. Teachers in the universities and colleges generate and disseminate knowledge through organic linkages with each other as also with the students through afacilitating physical and academic environment. There should be a tolerable zone of vacancies, preferably within 5 to 10 per cent of the sanctioned strength. The ambitious plans ofexpanding the higher education sector during the Eleventh Plan would remain substantially unfulfilled if the supply of teachers does not match the expanding demandfor them. The PRCfirmly believes that all-out eflorts to liquidate the existing stock ofvacancies, through attractive pay packages and better working/service conditions, is the " most essentialfirst step. In particular, it is high time that many of the State governments which are reported to have been clamping embargofrom time to time, under different pretexts, most noticeably the resource crunch, on filling up the sanctioned vacancies, need to review their ‘close-fist ’policy, in their own interest. — is an inescapable policy step, to reduce the supply demand gaps."</em></p>
			<p>The 11th plan recognized the problem of faculty in the universities and colleges and initiated policy measures both of short and medium term nature.</p> 
			<p>The short ‘vim measure includes a few steps. It includes increase in the retirement age up to 65 years which has already been done by the Ministry ofHuman Resource Development.</p>
			<p>The states are expected to follow up so that in coming five years we are able to meet the problem partially. It also includes removing the restrictions on the recruitment of faculty by the state and filling of the vacant posts. Several states have now relaxed the restrictions and taken steps to fill the teaching post in colleges and universities.</p>
			<p>The medium term steps include a number of measures. The important among them is the increase in the number of research fellowships for M.Phil. and Ph.D. and Post-Doctoral Program to create potential faculty for universities and colleges. The number of fellowships and amount through National Eligibility Test (NET) has been increased. Similarly the fellowship through Non-NET has been increasing. For instance all M.Phil. and Ph.D. non-fellowship holders in Central universities are given fellowship of Rs 3000 and Rs 5000 per month respectively. Similarly fellowships are given to science students in department/centre with special assistance program in State Universities and Central Universities, Autonomous Colleges and Colleges with Potential for Excellence. The other fellowships include Rajiv Gandhi Fellowship for SC and ST students. Yet other initiative include two Post-Doctoral fellowships, namely Kothari Post Doctoral Fellowships in sciences and Radhakrishnan Post-Doctoral Fellowships in social sciences.</p>
			<p>In science there is a special initiative which is undertaken by the Empowerment Committee. This includes Ph.D. fellowships and Kothari Post-Doctoral Fellowships which is mentioned above. Besides, the Empowered Committee also introduced ‘Operation Faculty Re-Charge Scheme' for 1000 faculty members. The Ph.D., Post-Doctoral and Re-Charge Scheme will create supply of potential faculty in medium-term.</p>
			<p>The Pay Review Committee has addressed the issue of attracting talent in teaching profession by recommending improved salary structure and service condition.</p>
			<p>All these measure are expected to increase the supply of faculty for the universities and colleges in medium term.</p>
			<p>The UGC has also proposed schemes to increase the involvement of researchers, scientists and academicians from outside the university system in teaching and research in universities/colleges in various ways. This also includes schemes to attract and facilitate the Indian academics working in universities outside India as well as the foreign academics working in India to participate in teaching and research on flexible terms and conditions.</p>
			<p><strong>Policy for Assessment and Accreditation</strong></p>
			<p>At present assessment and accreditation of universities and colleges is voluntary. The 11th plan has recommended the policy of compulsory assessment and accreditation. In view of this the UGC is developing a procedure to introduce mandatory assessment and accreditation for universities and colleges. Towards that end the UGC has also approve a scheme for establishment of Quality Assessment Cell in universities and colleges for regular internal self assessment and self monitoring of quality and excellence both steps will help to present an all India quality map of the universities and colleges.</p>
			<p><strong>Quality and Excellence linkages</strong></p>
			<p>The UGC recognizes the difference between quality and excellence. It recognized that excellence may not be enhanced without quality education in the vast institutions of higher learning, namely the universities and colleges. If only 9 universities and 100 colleges are recognized as Potential for Excellence and only 520 centers/departments have been identified as those with various level of excellence, it is because the universities and colleges suffer from the lack of adequate academic and physical infrastructure. This implies that a focus on improving the academic and physical infrastructure for quality improvement is a pre-condition. It is the presence of quality institutions which will generate and induce excellence in terms of creativity and innovativeness among the teachers and students. Excellence cannot be imposed from above. Good quality institutions lead to emergence of excellence in terms of creativity and innovativeness. In other words, without quality the excellence will not emerge and grow. The quality education, at the college and university level, serves as a ground for excellence to grow. The university and college education system serves as a catchment area for some quality centers/departments to emerge as centers of excellence. If the quality of the university and college education is neglected, it will have limited potential for growth of excellence in terms of creativity and innovativeness. Quality and Inclusiveness</p>
			<p><strong>Quality and Inclusiveness</strong></p>
			<p>There is another aspect related to quality which needs to be borne in mind. In the 11th Plan the goal is expansion with inclusive and quality education. The expansion with inclusiveness essentially means that increase in enrolment will have to come from the groups whose GER is low. The studies in this volume indicate that these include groups such as scheduled tribe, scheduled caste, semi-nomadic and de-notified tribes, women, religious minorities like Muslims, low caste converts to Islam, (SC and OBC Muslim) Buddhism, (Neo-Buddhist) Sikhism, (SC Sikh) Christianity (Dalit Christian) and poor in general, particularly from the rural areas.</p>
			<p>To provide quality education to these sections which constitute the bulk of those with lower access to higher education is an issue which the 11th Plan recognized. However, an improved access to quality education will require special attention for improvement in the language skills and other capabilities (to those who need), so that they are able to cope with learning in the universities and colleges. Therefore, quality improvement programs will be necessary for them. The issue of quality education cannot be de-linked from that of inclusiveness. Therefore, as mentioned above, a number of steps are proposed in the 11th plan, including setting up of Equal Opportunity Office to deal with all schemes for these social groups, which will help to promote inclusive education with quality.</p>
			<p><strong>Quality and Academic and Administrative Reforms of University and College System</strong></p>
			<p>Another important constituent for improvement of quality in higher education is the initiative for academic and administrative reforms in universities and colleges education system. The 11th Plan recognized the need to introduce the academic reform in the university and college system. The academic reform necessarily includes changes in admission procedures in various courses; modification in assessment and examination methods; switchover from annual to semester system; acceptance of grade and credit system; teachers' assessments; and other related reforms.</p>
			<p>It is now recognized that the admission to various courses, as far as possible, be made through written test and viva, particularly for M.Phil. and Ph.D., and be transparent in nature, with due regard to the government policy of reservation. There is also an advantage and hence the need to switch - over to semester system from the annual cycle of examination system, wherever possible. Equally important is the change in the examination and assessment of the students. It is realized that there is a need to bring a major component of internal assessment through tutorial, essay writing, seminar and presentation by students and subsequent reduction in the written component. Similarly, there is need to adopt credit system with credit accumulation. The UGC had written to the various universities about the needs of these academic reforms. A number of universities have welcomed these reforms.</p>
			<p><strong>Other Reforms</strong></p>
			<p>The 11th Plan has also expressed the need to go for reform of higher education system in other spheres as well. The other important initiatives include reforms of affiliating system; preparing frameworks for public-private partnerships, rationalization of fee structures; regulation of Deemed Universities; rationalization of admission and fee structures of Deemed Universities; regulatory frameworks for collaboration by universities and colleges with universities and institutions in other countries with respect to dual degree arrangements; sharing of courses; credit transfers; and sharing of teaching, etc. The UGC has set up various committees on these reforms. The reports of some of them have been already finalized.</p>
			<p><strong>Promotion of Relevant Education</strong></p>
			<p>In the 11th Five Year Plan there is a huge initiative for the promotion of relevant education. The Plan recognized that the relevant education will involve not only providing knowledge (as it exists at a given point of time) to the students but also the various skills associated with the subjects. Therefore, UGC has undertaken exercise to take stock of the present curriculum at various level of higher education and set up a Committee under the Chairmanship of Professor Yash Pal to come with a framework. In the spheres of vocational and technical education huge initiative has been taken by the Ministry of Human Resource Development through expansion of vocational and technical education. This includes creation of 8 new IITs, 20 NITS, 20 IITs, 3 IISERs, 7 IIMS, 2 SPAs, new Polytechnics in un-served districts, 500 new community Polytechnics, and 210 new community colleges. This will help to expand the intake capacity of existing vocational and technical institutions in public sectors. The UGC has also taken initiative to introduce the concept of Community College in general education.</p>
			<p><strong>Inter-university Centre of Research, Policy and Monitoring of Higher Education (UGC)</strong></p>
			<p>A Committee set up by UGC under the Chairmanship of Professor Tapas Mazumdar has recommended the need to set up an Institution for Research, Policy and Monitoring of Higher Education. The Committee observed that planning and monitoring of the vast and one of the largest higher education systems in the world comprising over 450 universities, more than 20,000 colleges, several other non-degree educational institutions, the larger Distance Education System serving a vast section of student community across the country, also involving more than five lakh teachers and about 16 million students require proper data and information base and study on multiple aspects. The lack of institution of proper dimension has constrained our capacity to develop well-grounded policies and programs. It, therefore, recommended setting up of such an Institute.</p>
			<p>Among other things, the purpose of this Inter-University Centre will be to build up a data-base on all aspects of higher education, assess and monitor the schemes to assist UGC in grant-making policies. Also through constant research and assessment it will help develop policies, schemes and give feedback and advice to ministry and also to universities and colleges on a number of issues on a regular basis.</p>
			<p>It will have divisions related to Finance, Fee and Loan, Quality and Excellence, Curricula Monitoring, Equal Opportunity, Governance, Examination System, Admission Methods, Private sector Role, International aspects of higher education and other related issues. It will be an autonomous body to provide support to UGC and to the government on a regular basis.</p>
			<p><strong>Concluding observations</strong></p>
			<p>I have presented the issues related to expansion, inclusiveness, quality and relevance and also discussed the way in which these issues are addressed in the 11th Plan. The central objective of the 11th Plan is now focused on “Expansion of Enrolment in Higher Education with Inclusiveness, Quality, and Relevant Education” and supported by necessary academic reforms in the university and college system. The 11th Plan developed an approach and strategy to address the issues facing Indian Higher Education System. It is necessary that the individual State governments also take similar initiatives in their respective State Plans and develop policies to address the issue of increasing the enrolment-rate, equal access to groups with lower access to higher education, issue of quality, relevant education and of various academic reforms.</p>

			<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong> JUSTICE DR. M. RAMA JOIS</strong></p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>Former Governor of Bihar and Jharkhand<br /> Former Chief Justice of Panjab and Haryana High Court<br />Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha)</em></p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>March 7<sup>th</sup>, 2010﻿</em></p>
			<p><em>Your Excellency Sri. H.R. Bhardwaj, Governor of Karnataka and the Chancellor, the University of Mysore, the Vice-Chancellor Prof. V.G. Talwar, Hon'ble Members of the Syndicate of the University and other dignitaries present at this function, University Teachers and Students who will be securing the various degrees at this Convocation who constitute the hope for the better future of our Nation and other sisters and brothers,</em></p>
			<p>Being a graduate in Science and Law of the Mysore University of 1954 and 1958, I feel greatly honoured to have been invited to deliver the Ninetieth Convocation Address of this great University. Convocation Address to those who have secured degrees from the University and are on the threshold of entering various professions or occupations or avocations or in some cases undertaking still higher education is a momentous occasion in the life of every student and his/her parents. At the outset, I congratulate all of them and I wish all the students obtaining their degrees in this convocation astounding success in life and all-round happiness to them, to their parents and other members of their family.</p>
			<p>I congratulate the University for conferring the Hon. Doctorate degree on Smt. Meira Kumar, the first Woman Speaker of the Lok Sabha and Sri. Sukhadevo Thorat, Chairman of UGC and Sri. Govardhan Mehta, Chairman, National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), who richly deserve such distinction.</p>
			<p>On this important occasion feeling of deep sense of gratitude is uppermost in my mind to the Maharajas of Mysore who had ruled the former State of Mysore for over five centuries. After the fall of the great, never-to-be-forgotten Vijayanagar Empire in 1565 AD the area of the erstwhile State of Mysore came under the rule of Wadeyars. The excellent manner in which they ruled the State is described in an article entitled “Early Wadeyars of Mysore” by Sri. D.A. Achuta Rao in the Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society Cultural Heritage No. 1956 at pages 179-194. Relevant portion reads:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><strong>“The Mysore Dynasty produced some of its outstanding rulers in Raja Wadeyar, Chamaraja Wadeyar, Kanteerava Narasaraja-1, Devaraja, Chikkadevaraja who helped to preserve and foster to a great degree all that was great and noble in Hindu culture which had found its efflorescence under the Vijayanagara rule. The vast body of literary and epigraphical material relating to the history of the <em>Wadeyars of Mysore reflect the high ideals of kingship which inspired</em> them in their administration of the country, <em>ideals which were in conformity with those expounded in ancient Indian literature like the Smritis and Dharmashastras. Like Kings of yore, they ruled agreeably according to Dharma.</em></strong></p>
			<p>Sri. V.P. Menon in his account of the rule of Krishnaraja Wadeyar, the penultimate ruler, stated thus:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><strong>“...Maharaja Sri. Krishnaraja Wadeyar, who ruled for forty six years, was the most distinguished ruler Mysore ever had; the State made remarkable progress under his guidance”.<em> [Indian States, p.292)</em></strong></p>
			<p>Sri Jayachamarajendra Wadeyar, the last ruler, succeeded Krishnaraja Wadeyar in August 1940 when he was just 21 years. During the nine years of his rule, he too followed the high traditions of his uncle and his predecessors and had endeared himself to the people of the State as an able and benevolent ruler.</p>
			<p>Moreover he was an eminent educationist and an outstanding scholar which is evidenced by the fact that every year he used to go abroad to deliver Guest Lectures in the great Universities of the World, at their invitation. The Mysore Maharajas rule is worthy of emulation by democratic rulers.</p>
			<p>The University of Mysore was established by Sri Krishnaraja Wadeyar, IV on 27th July 1916 under the able leadership of Sir M. Vishveshwarayya of universal fame who was then the Dewan of Mysore. I feel immensely fortunate and proud for the reason my date of birth is the same in the year 1931.</p>
			<p>The University of Mysore by its excellent achievements earned a mark of great distinction. Great personalities like Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Sir Ashuthosh Mukherjee, B.M. Srikantaiah, Prof. Rollo, Prof. S. Ramachandra Rao, Prof. A.N. Murthy Rao, Dr. K. V. Puttappa and a galaxy of eminent professors had not only taught but also created eminent educationists and professors. I find it difficult to refer to all other names as the list is too big. I express my sincere gratitude and make my obeisance to all of them.</p>
			<p>With this preface I proceed to share some of my thoughts for the benefit of all those who are receiving degrees in this Convocation.</p>
			<p>All of you have been extremely fortunate for having got an opportunity to have University education in this great University. The Mysore University is one of the oldest and glorious Universities established by the then Maharaja of Mysore Sri. Krishnadevaraja Wadeyar-IV. It has grown in its breadth and length with 43 post-graduate departments offering as many as 75 post-graduate degrees and diploma courses, 48 research centres, spread throughout the Country, 4 Constituent Colleges and 193 Affiliated Colleges. University of Mysore was the first formal State University to be accredited in 2000 by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with 'Five Star Status' and re-accredited in 2006 at’A+Level. Recognizing the progress and potential of this University, the Government of India has awarded the status of 'Institution of Excellence with Rs. 100 crore assistance for undertaking research in the area of “Bio-diversity, Bio-prospects and Sustainable Developments” and to establish a Centre of Excellence in the said area and also for improving the overall infrastructure of this University. The Government of Karnataka has considered University of Mysore ‘a Model University' in 2009.</p>
			<p>I have learnt from several engineers employed in North India in the last century that they were selected and appointed without even an interview on seeing that their engineering degree was from the Mysore University. That has been the reputation of Mysore University. This should be maintained.</p>
			<p><strong>Establishment of Oriental Research Institute:</strong></p>
			<p>This was established earlier in 1891 by the Maharaja. Kautilya's <em>Arthsastra</em> the most authoritative work on <em>Raja Dharma,</em> our ancient Constitutional Law was discovered, translated into English and published by the then Curator of the Institute Dr. R. Shama Sastry. Thereafter, this became the subject matter of translation into various languages of the world and subject matter of study in most of the Universities of the world. The most important guidance to the rulers given therein whatever be the form of Government, reads:</p>
			<p class="verse">प्रजासुखे सुखं राज्ञाः प्रजानां च हिते हितम् ।<br /> नात्मप्रियं हितं राज्ञाः प्रजानां तु प्रियं हितम् ॥</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>"In the happiness of the subjects lies the king's happiness, in their welfare his welfare; what pleases himself the king shall not consider good but whatever pleases his subjects the king shall consider good”.</em></p>
			<p>But for this Institute and the great contribution of Dr. R. Shama Sastry, the Nation and the World would have lost this valuable treasure. This year the Nation is celebrating with gratitude the Centenary of the publication of translated version of Kautilya's Arthasastra. I had the honour of delivering the Key-Note Address at the Osmania University on 30-1-2010.</p> 
			<p><strong>Education is most fundamental to human development</strong></p>
			<p>As to the importance given to education in ancient Bharat, it is sufficient to quote the following verse composed by the great Sanskrit poet Bhartruhari of the first century BC:</p>
			<p class="verse">विद्या नाम वरस्य रुपमधिकंप्रच्छत्रगुप्तधनं<br /> विद्याभोगकरीयशः सुखकरीविद्यागुरुणांगुरुः ।<br /> विद्या बन्धुजनो विदेशगमने विद्या परं दैवतं<br /> विद्या राजसूपूजितानतुधनं विद्याविहीनः पशुः ॥</p>
			<p><em>Education is the special manifestation of man;</em></p>
			<p><em>Education is the treasure which can be preserved without the fear of loss,</em></p>
			<p><em> Education secures material pleasure, happiness and fame;</em></p>
			<p><em> Education is the teacher of the teacher;</em></p>
			<p><em>Education is the friend when one goes abroad;</em></p>
			<p><em>Education is God incarnate; Education secures honour at the hands of the State, not money;</em></p>
			<p><em> A man without education is equal to animal.</em></p>
			<p>In the above verse, Bartruhari, king of Ujjain turned philosopher apart from highlighting the importance of education to life, equated man without education to an animal. By saying so, he wanted to impress upon everyone about the pious obligation of every individual to acquire and disseminate knowledge to the next generation. This aspect of our civilization is alluded to by the Supreme Court in the case of Mohini Jain [1992 (3) S.C.C. 666 at 682] in which while holding that right to education must be regarded as a fundamental right, the Court said thus:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><strong>“Indian civilization recognises education as one of the pious obligations of the human society. To establish and administer educational institutions is considered a religious and charitable object. Education in India has never been a commodity for sale”. (Para-18]</strong></p>
			<p>Again in the case of Unnikrishnan (AIR 1993 SC 2178] in order to make out that the right to education constitutes part of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court said that the importance of education was emphasized by Bhartruhari [First Century BC] and quoted the above said verse in full to eulogize education and stated what more is necessary to say that “Right to Education” is a fundamental right? This right which was mentioned as only a Directive Principle in Articles 41, 45 and 46 was thereafter included as a Fundamental Right in Article 21-A in the Constitution pursuant to the above judgment.</p>
			<p>Sarvajna Narayana in his celebrated work <em>Hitopadesha</em> eulogized education in the following verse:</p>
			<p class="verse">अन्नदानात्परंदानं विद्यादानमतः परं <br />अत्रेन क्षणिकातृप्तिः ङ्गावज्जीवन्तु विद्याङ्गा</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>“Providing education is of greater value than providing food, for, satisfaction secured from food is short-lived whereas the satisfaction secured from education remains throughout life”</em></p>
			<p>The comparison is given not to belittle the importance of offering food to the needy but to indicate that by transmitting knowledge the giver does not lose anything but the recipient secures everlasting benefit and he becomes an asset to the society.</p>
			<p>It is also pertinent to quote another verse which eulogizes the role of “Guru'.</p>
			<p class="verse">अज्ञानतिमिरांधरङ्ग ज्ञानंजन शलखङ्गा<br /> चक्षुरुन्मीलितंङ्गेन तस्मैश्री गुरुवे नमः</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>"My obeisance to Guru who opens the eyes of those who are immersed in darkness of Ajnana [lack of knowledge]using the instrument of Knowledge.”</em></p>
			<p>I am referring to the above points only to make every one of you realize the great benefit all of you have derived from your teachers individually and from the University as an institution so that a sense of gratitude should be uppermost in the mind of all of you and you should do nothing in your life-time which is derogatory to all of them.</p>
			<p><strong>Duty-based Society</strong></p>
			<p>The unique method evolved by the great thinkers who moulded the civilization and culture of this land was to secure the rights to every individuals by creating a corresponding duty in other individuals. This was for the reason that they considered that sense of right always emanates from selfishness whereas the sense of duty always proceeds from selflessness. Therefore, various kinds of rights evolved became values of Bharatiya culture which were based on the duty of every individual towards other individuals. The creation of a duty in one individual necessarily resulted in the creation of a right in the other individual and in the protection of such a right.</p>
			<p>Therefore, instead of making right as the foundation of social life and establishing a right-based society, the ancient philosophers of this land preferred to establish a duty-based society, where the right given to an individual is <strong><em>the right to perform his duty.</em></strong> This fundamental approach to life has been clearly laid down and understood in the entire ancient literature. To illustrate, in Vishnupurana, there is a complete chapter devoted to defining the territorial boundaries as well as the basic philosophy of this Country. The importance given to duty in this land is emphasised in one of the verses therein, which reads:</p>
			<p class="verse">अत्रापि भारत श्रेष्ठ जम्बूद्वीपे महामुने ।<br /> यतो हि कर्मभूरेषा ततोऽन्या भोगभूमयः ॥</p>
			<p>Among the various countries, Bharat is regarded as great because this is the land of duty in contradistinction to others which are lands of enjoyment, i.e., based on rights.</p>
			<p>Mahatma Gandhi eulogized this idealism in the following words:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><strong>“India is to me the dearest country in the world, not because it is my country but because I have discovered the greatest goodness in it... Everything in India attracts me. It has everything that human being with the highest possible aspirations can want.</strong></p>
			<p><strong><em>India is essentially Karmabhumi [Land of Duty) in contradistinction to Bhogabhumi [Land of Enjoyment?”</em></strong></p>
			<p><strong>[My Picture of Free India, P-1]</strong></p>
			<p>What is the significance? The answer is extremely important. According to the culture evolved in this land, everyone owes a duty towards others and by this method, the right of an individual was made part of the duty of other individuals and thereby the principle of mutual love and protection for the happiness of all was sought to be ensured.</p>
			<p>For example, the duty of parents towards their children, and the duty of sons and/ or daughters, as the case may be, to maintain their parents in old age, and the duty of teachers towards their students, the duty of students towards their teachers, the duty of every individual in a family towards other individuals in the family and other members of the concerned human society, the duty of the State towards citizens. <em>Raja Dharma</em> declared that equal treatment of all irrespective of their religion was the fundamental duty of the State as follows:</p>
			<p class="verse">यथा सर्वाणि सूतानि धरा धरायते समम् ।<br /> तथा सर्वाणि भूतानि बिभ्रतः पार्थिवं व्रतम् ॥</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>Just as the mother-earth gives equal support to all the living beings, a king should give support to all without any discrimination. [Manu IX-311]</em></p>
			<p>Narada Smriti vide Dharmokosha P-870 laid down thus:</p>
			<p class="verse">पाषण्डनैगमश्रेणीपूगव्रातगणादिषु ।<br /> संरक्षेत्समयं राजा दुर्गें जनपदे तथा ॥</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>The King should afford protection to compacts of association of disbelievers in the Vedas in the same manner and to the same extent as is given to believers in the Vedas and all others just as he protects his territory</em></p>
			<p>Thus, secularism par excellence has been the basic structure of <em>Raja Dharma</em> and the same is incorporated in the Constitution of India.</p>
			<p>This fundamental philosophy or attitude was somehow omitted in the Constitution of India which, in fact, should have been the first article. But it is heartening to note that “Fundamental Duties were incorporated in Part-IVA of the Constitution by the 42nd amendment. In view of its great importance, I prefer to quote the entire chapter.</p>
			<p><strong>51A Fundamental Duties: It shall be the duty of every citizen of India:</strong></p>
			<p>a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem;</p>
			<p>b)to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;</p>
			<p>c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;</p>
			<p>d) to defend the Country and render national service when called upon to do so;</p>
			<p>e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women;</p>
			<p>f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;</p>
			<p>g) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures;</p>
			<p>h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;.</p>
			<p>i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence;</p>
			<p>j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement.</p>
			<p>Please remember every one of these duties and make yourself a duty-based individual and not right-based, which will make you a real human. Chief Justice J.S. Verma has recommended that this chapter should be made part of school and college curriculum.</p>
			<p><strong>Four pious obligations of individuals</strong></p>
			<p>Having made our Society a duty-based one, four pious obligation of every individual were laid down in the Mahabharata, five thousand years ago.</p>
			<p>The relevant verse in the <em>Mahabharata</em> ‘Adiparva', Ch. 120-17-20, in which these four pious obligations have been indicated, state:</p>
			<p class="verse">ऋणैश्रतुर्भिः संयुक्ता जायन्ते मानवा भुवि ।<br /> पितृदेवर्षिमनुजैदैयं तेभ्यश्र धर्मतः ॥</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>“Every individual should discharge four pious obligations. They are Devaruna (towards God), Pitruruna (towards parents), Rishiruna (towards teachers) and Manavaruna (towards humanity)”.</em></p>
			<p>All the four obligations were founded on the sense of gratitude, the most fundamental among values of life. 'Devaruna? was required to be discharged by worshipping God in any manner one pleased. “Pitruruna' was required to be discharged by begetting sons and daughters, educating and leaving them as asset to the Society. Among these four pious obligations, the third one namely, “Rishiruna' is relevant to the present topic. According to this pious obligation, every individual is duty-bound to acquire knowledge, to give it back to the society by making useful addition to it and to use it for securing happiness to fellow human beings.</p>
			<p>Individuals in every generation were bound to discharge their debt due to the previous generation of scholars, teachers, educationists etc., who had conserved, developed and transmitted knowledge to their next generation. Please discharge these pious obligations to the best of your ability.</p>
			<p><strong>Right to happiness is basic human right - measure of happiness</strong></p>
			<p>From times immemorial, the right to happiness of all has been laid down as a comprehensive human right of all. This is the mark of great distinction of Bharatiya Culture. This is expressed in the famous statements <strong>“Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinaha"</strong> and <strong>"Lokaha Samastaha Sukhino Bhavantu”</strong> meaning, all should be happy.</p>
			<p>The human right to education is aimed at securing happiness. The aim of education should be the all-round development of personality-intellectual, mental, moral and physical and to make an individual an asset to the society. It is only then a Nation or society is able to achieve success in creating substantial number of such individuals, it secures happiness. This aspect is highlighted in <em>Taittiriyopanishad</em> which reads:</p>
			<p class="verse">युवा स्यात्साधु युवाऽध्यायकः ।<br />आशिष्ठो द्रढिष्ठॊ बलिष्ठः ।<br /> तस्येयं पृथिवी सर्व विवस्य पूर्णा स्यात् ।<br />स एको मानुष आनन्दः ॥</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>“Happiness is this, youth should be of good character, learned, resolute and strong (morally and physically). Then only the earth will be full of prosperity and wealth. This is the measure of human happiness".</em></p>
			<p>This lesson is highly enlightening. It declares that the real happiness and prosperity of any Nation is directly proportional to the number of youths who are well educated, of sterling character, healthy and physically strong, devoid of bad habits. If youths are devoid of anyone of these, instead of becoming a source of happiness and an asset to the Nation, they will become a liability. That is the biggest problem our Nation is facing Remember, the acquisition of these qualities in yourselves is a life-long process.</p>
			<p><strong>Scrupulously follow the doctrine of Trivarga</strong></p>
			<p>“Trivarga Siddhanta” was evolved by ancient seers having realized that the fulfillment of desires of human beings was essential to secure happiness, but they were of the opinion that unless the desires were regulated by <em>Dharma</em> (Righteous Code of Conduct) they would bring about undesirable results. Therefore, all the propounders of <em>Dharma</em> were unanimous that for the existence of an orderly society and peace and to secure the basic human right of happiness to all, the desires (kama) for material enjoyment, and earning wealth or money (Artha) should always conform to Dharma and be never inconsistent with it. This was called the <em>“Doctrine of Trivarga"</em> and was incorporated in the following three lines:</p>
			<p class="verse">धर्मार्थावुच्यते श्रेयः कामार्थौ धर्म एव च । <br />अर्थ एवेह वा श्रेयस्त्रिवर्ग इति तु स्थितिः ॥<br /> परित्यजेदर्थकामौ यौ स्यातां धर्मवर्जितौ ।</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>To achieve welfare and happiness some declare Dharma and Artha are good. Others declare that Artha and Kama are better. Still others declare that Dharma is the best. There are also persons who declare Artha alone secures happiness.</em></p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>But the correct view is that the aggregate of Dharma, Artha and Kama (Trivarga) secures welfare and happiness.</em></p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>However, the desire (kama) and material wealth (Artha) must be rejected if contrary to Dharma. [Manu II 224 &#38; IV 176]</em></p>
			<p>In this single verse <em>Manu Smriti</em> has considered the merits of pure materialism (Artha and Kama) and of mere spiritualism (Dharma without Artha) and concluded that it is the combination of Dharma, Artha and Kama which secures welfare and happiness with an overriding principle that desire (kama) and material wealth (artha) should be rejected if they are inconsistent with Dharma and calls this doctrine TRIVARGA. There can be no better rule or philosophy than Trivarga, for the welfare of the individual and society. It strikes a harmonious balance between the interests of the individual and the Society.</p>
			<p>It is significant to point out that four ideals of life or Purusharthas namely, Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha were laid down in Bharatiya way of life as applicable to all. As Moksha' relates to the other unknown world and falls into the region of religion, doctrine of Trivarga' was evolved for the mundane world omitting Moksha, as a binding rule for securing peace and happiness both individually as well as collectively.</p>
			<p>All our ancient literature including the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, all the Smritis, Kautilya's Arthasastra are unanimous that following of Rule of Trivarga is the panacea for all human problems. It is unfortunate that such an element of basic structure of our culture remains ignored in our National Education System.</p>
			<p>In his Foreword to my book “TRIVARGA" published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Justice Krishna Iyer says thus:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>Trivarga was not any occult science nor riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. It was basic to social order with world-wide validity. “TRIVARGA" comprising of three inseparable ideals namely Dharma (Righteous Code of Conduct), Artha (every type of wealth) and Kama (every type of desires of human beings) as a permanent and effective solution for all human problems was put in the form of an injunction to all human beings in one line:</em></p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>“Reject wealth (artha) and desires (kama) which are contrary to Dharma (righteous code of conduct) " namely "Ahimsa (non-- violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (not acquiring illegitimate wealth), Shaucham (purity) and Indriyanigraha (control of senses) are, in brief the common dharma for all the varnas.</em></p>
			<p><em>The trinity of fundamentals - Dharma, Artha, Kama - which constitutes the constellation is collectively expressed as Trivarga.</em></p>
			<p>The glorious epics, the Manusmriti, Kautilya's Arthashastra and other classics governed the ruler and the ruled. Indeed, the rules of Dharma govern every sphere of activity, every profession, every avocation. The doctrine of Trivarga is an enduring system of values holding good in the social, political domestic and international planes of human business.</p>
			<p>Dharma' is the controlling factor and this word happens to be the most misunderstood and misinterpreted as religion. Therefore, I consider it appropriate to give the real meaning of Dharma.</p>
			<p class="verse">अक्रोधः सत्यवचन संविभागः क्षमा तथा ।<br /> प्रजनः स्वेषु दारेषु शौचमद्रोह एव च ॥<br />आर्जवं भृत्यभरणं नयैते सावंवर्णिकाः ॥</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>Truthfulness, to be free from anger, sharing wealth with others (samvibhaga), forgiveness, procreation of children from one's wife alone, purity, absence of enmity, straightforwardness and maintaining persons dependent on oneself are the nine rules of the Dharma of persons belonging to all the varnas. Mahabharata, “Shantiparva’ 6-7-8]</em></p>
			<p><em>Manu Smriti is more concise and brought 'Dharma' under five heads,</em></p>
			<p class="verse">अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं शौचमिन्द्रियनिग्रहः ।<br /> एतं सामासिकं धर्म चातुर्वण्यैऽब्रवीन्मनुः ॥</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth fulness), Asteya (not acquiring illegitimate wealth), Shoucham (purity), and Indriyanigraha (control of senses) are, in brief, the common Dharma for all the varnas. (Manu X-163]</em></p>
			<p>A reading of each one of the above rules at once makes an individual realise what he should do and what he should not do. The observance of the above rules alone secures real happiness and harmony in life. It is significant to note that there is no reference to God' who is the basis of all religions.</p>
			<p>Thus, there is a vast difference between Dharma and Religion. All the rules of righteous conduct in every sphere of human activity evolved from times immemorial in this country, falls within the meaning of the word “Dharma”. Religion means mode of worship of God by all believers calling him by different names. There are many religions. There are instances of religious fanaticism creating conflict. Religion might divide but Dharma unites. It applies to all human beings. It sustains life. It does not create conflict.</p>
			<p>I have incorporated all this in my book <em>Legal and Constitutional History of India</em> (Ancient Indian Legal, Judicial and Constitutional System) published in 1984 which is recommended by the Bar Council of India to be a textbook on the subject for the Law Degree Courses in India. I had presented the first copy of the book to the University of Mysore with deep sense of gratitude as my ‘Gurudakshina'. Now I am presenting four copies of my book "Trivarga” published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan to my ‘alma-mater'.</p>
			<p>Please understand the correct meaning of Dharma and have this doctrine of Trivarga inculcated in your heart which will serve as an internal check and prevent you from entertaining and implementing sinful thoughts.</p>
			<p><strong>Present state of affairs</strong></p>
			<p>Today after six decades after independence, undoubtedly enormous development and progress in the field of university education has taken place. Large number of Universities and Colleges in all the faculties with good infrastructure and excellent facilities both in public and private sector have come into existence. We can be proud of it. But unfortunately while proficiency is acquired through these educational institutions in various subjects, one subject which is common to all the subjects, namely, creating men of character who conform to rule of “Trivarga” is conspicuous by its absence.</p>
			<p>As a result, I must say with agony that moral degradation is alarming. All our cultural values such as sense of gratitude, honesty, truthfulness, respect for womanhood, desire to live simple and less expensive life, desire to serve fellow human beings, sexual morality are progressively declining. Today we have replaced the rule of “Trivarga” by“Dwivarga” striking off sense of ‘Dharma' and we are after making more money and fulfill desire-resorting to illegal and immoral methods. As a result, we have eminent individuals in every profession or avocation but several of them minus ethics. That is the biggest problem the Nation is facing. This situation cannot be changed by law as the law is only punitive in nature in that it punishes after the offence is committed, whereas sense of Dharma is preventive in nature as it destroys sinful thoughts and prevents from committing offences. Apart from this, sexual immorality has increased alarmingly. It is relevant to quote the warning administered by Swami Vivekananda a century ago in the following words:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>"Shall India die? Then from the world all spirituality will be extinct, all moral perfection will be extinct, all sweet souled sympathy for religion will be extinct, all ideality will be extinct, and in its place will reign the duality of lust and luxury as the male and female deities, with money as its priest, fraud, force and competition as its ceremonies, and the human soul as its sacrifice.”</em></p>
			<p>The expression ‘India’ here means our culture. If it dies, these would be the consequences. We are already having the taste of such consequences as seen from day-to-day events and in Valentines. I need not explain further. <strong>Please remember seeking Temporary Pleasure is sure to lead to PERMANENT MISERY.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>How education becomes purposeful</strong></p>
			<p>Dr. S. Radhakrishnan in his work<em> The Principal Upanishads</em> in the course of his treatise on <em>Taittiriyopanishad</em>, quotes what Patanjali said about education:</p>
			<p>“Patanjali in his <em>Mahabhasya</em> [Kielhorn's ed. P-6] says there are four steps or stages through which knowledge becomes fruitful.</p>
			<p>* The first is when we acquire it from the teacher,</p>
			<p>* The second when we study it,</p>
			<p>* The third when we teach it to others and</p>
			<p>* The fourth when we apply it.</p>
			<p>In this short but meaningful passage, Patanjali highlighted four aspects of education to be accomplished. The directives to every individual thereby are:</p>
			<p>i. Acquire knowledge/ education from your parents and teachers;</p>
			<p>ii. Make your own study and improve the knowledge,</p>
			<p>iii. Impart value-added knowledge to other individuals, that is, to your own children as parent and to others as teacher or in any other capacity; and</p>
			<p>iv. Use that knowledge for your benefit and the benefit of your family and also render service to fellow human beings through your profession, avocation or employment etc. and do not use your knowledge for exploitation of fellow countrymen to satisfy the unlimited greed.</p>
			<p>These four aspects of education must be borne in mind by all.”</p>
			<p>That is why Swami Vivekananda declared that service to humanity is service to Divinity.</p>
			<p>I appeal to all of you to take an oath to the effect that</p>
			<p class="myquote"><strong><em>"Whatever may be the position that I am designed to occupy in the Society, I shall not earn money or fulfill my desires by methods which are illegal or immoral and that Bharatmata shall be the deity for my worship [Aradhya Devat) and patriotism shall be the method of worship”</em></strong></p>
			<p>as it was during the struggle for freedom. With this only you can reach higher and higher in your life and this is the only method by which you can do justice to yourself, to your parents, to this University and to the Nation and we shall be able to take our motherland “Bharat” to the pinnacle of glory.</p>
			<p>I pray Almighty to give all of you the necessary WILL power to do so.</p>
			<p>I conclude this address with the universally applicable prayer incorporated in <em>Kathopanishad.</em></p>
			<p>सह नाववतु । सह नौ भुनक्तु । सह वीर्यं करवावहै। तेजस्वि नावधीतमस्तु । मा विद्विषावहै । ॐ शांतिः शांतिः शांतिः ।</p>
			<p class="myquote"><strong>"May He [God) protect all of us together<br />Let us share the food together;<br /> May we work conjointly with greater energy<br /> May our study be vigorous and effective<br /><em>May we not hate any one</em><br /> let there be peace, peace and peace.”</strong></p>

			<p><strong>By<br /> DR. T. RAMASAMI</strong></p>
			<p><em>Department of Science and Technology<br />Government Of India<br />	New Delhi</em></p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>April 10<sup>th</sup>, 2011﻿</em></p>
			<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
			<p><em>Excellency the Governor of Karnataka, Honourable Minister for Higher Education, Vice-Chancellor, Members of the Senate and Syndicate, Distinguished personalities who are bestowed today with Honorary Doctorate, Deans of Faculty, Heads of Departments, Faculty, Parents and Members of the families, Students, Grandaunts, representatives of the Media, Guests, Distinguished Citizens, Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen, let me begin this address with warmest congratulations to all the new graduates who are at the threshold of a new beginning in life.</em></p>
			<p>Graduation day is always special. It is special on account of many fronts. Some events provide us a life--changing experience. At the time of the event, we may not recognize the life-changing nature of the experience. When we contemplate, may be after several years, we may end up recognizing that the life was never the same after some special events. For some, this day could well be one; but let me wish for everyone of you that the life ahead is wholesome and enriching. I have delivered more convocation addresses than I have kept count of, but every time I see new people receiving degrees, I seem to want to say something special for the group. Today, I wish to share with you some thoughts on <strong>“Education for a Resurgent Nation: The India-2035”.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>India 1835</strong></p>
			<p>Two centuries ago, a renowned British General addressed his Parliament thus</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>“I have traveled across the length and . breadth of India and have not seen one person who is a beggar, who is a thief, such wealth I have seen in this country, such high moral values, people of such caliber that I do not think that we would ever conquer this country, unless we break the backbone of this Nation, which is her spiritual and cultural heritage, and, therefore, I propose that we replace her old education system, her culture, for if Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than their own, they will lose their self-esteem, their native culture, and they will become what we want them, a truly dominated Nation”.</em></p>
			<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, that was from the Address of Lord Macaulay' on 2nd Feb 1835 to the British Parliament. That was the India of 1835. Nalanda had dominated the world of learning for more than one thousand years. Remnants of rich educational legacy had remained as late as 1835. Education systems of the then India were dismantled. A new system was introduced. It was designed to suit the educated to serve the then rulers. By 1935, India was truly a dominated Nation where the spirit had been overpowered. Is there a scope for resurgence of the once dominated Nation? If we continued along the path of the past, may be, we will remain dominated? I hope that some of our educators will contemplate on this important question and change the course.</p>
			<p><strong>India-2010</strong></p>
			<p>In 2010, the Nation is a resurgent India. She is re-emerging as a global economic power. In 1835, India enjoyed a share of more than one-fourth of the global economic product. She has regained her economic fundamentals. She is moving faster than others in the world of economy where market is the king and money is the legal tender. With the present education system designed to meet the needs of the job markets, Indians come with a premium on account of their analytical strength and the "minds-on” character. We are multiplying our centres of higher education in haste. We are filling classrooms with children and learners. About 1.5 and 1 crore young people took their class X and XII examinations, respectively in 2009. Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education is increasing significantly. About 3 crore young people are likely to enter college education in 2035. The resurgent India speaks of demographic dividend in 2010. Our literacy rate has increased from 64%to 74% plus during the last decade.</p>
			<p>Has there been matching increase in the number of educated? Let us spend a few minutes contemplating on the veracity of this question. This would make us to reflect on the purpose of education itself.</p>
			<p><strong>Purpose of Education: Differences in Perceptions of East and West</strong></p>
			<p>It may seem a simplistic approach to seek answers to the question as to whether there is a single purpose to education. May be, there are several purposes. What the modern society seems to seek from education is access to better standard of living and physical well-being. Is that all we expect from education? In the ancient system of education in India, focus was on the development of personality and a total human being.</p>
			<p>Indian ethos believed that human being was a perfect creation of Mother Nature and education was needed to reveal the perfection embedded in everyone of us. It was focussed on the needs for elevating one's thought and addressed the needs of the soul. The Theory of Anomie of the west believed that humanbeing was generally lawless and education made him or her lawabiding. It gave prescriptions for survival in the “world of survival of the fittest”.</p>
			<p><strong>Education: As a preparation of mind for combat in the worldstage</strong></p>
			<p>Education could be seen as a process of preparation of unprepared minds. Then one could ask preparation for what? Some might believe that it was meant for enriching of the minds while some others reckon that it was for enriching one's purse. The reality of the world where material aggression rules the world order, combativeness of the world sets the stage. Education today is focussed on winning in competitions, more through the tools of training and rigor rather than-education. We celebrate the championships, world cups and other symbols of success. We forget that for every winner there are many losers. Without some losers, there is no winner either. Modern education has prepared our minds for such a mindset, where winning is the purpose and spiritual elevation of thought is secondary.</p>
			<p><strong>Is there a Dichotomy of two cultures of education in modern India?</strong></p>
			<p>Competition has become the buzzword globally. Competitive world demands new skills. It calls for an attitude to develop counter-offensives to the laws of the competitive world. The other day, I happened to see a movie called “3-idiots”. It illustrated the reality that readjustment to the social belief that “World is a Market” is difficult for the believers of“World is a family”. I was asking myself the question as to whether such a movie would have recreated the reality better in any country other than India. I felt, perhaps not.</p>
			<p>A dichotomy depicted in “3-idiots" seems to prevail in the modern education system. On the one hand, we miss the value of our ancient education methodologies where development of personality of the learner formed the focus. We do not seem to be satisfied fully with wealth creating ability of education alone as a society. One common subject of discussion is “declining quality of educational systems in India with each generation”. On the other hand, the desire to arrive at the world-stage as a country in resurgence, we seem to seek to learn methods of competitive excellence. We seem to seek the power of education rather than the spirit of education as one of knowing and gaining knowledge.</p>
			<p>I am not speaking about the internal conflicts of each human-being at his or her own individual levels. I am meaning to say that we, as a society, seem to be passing through the internal dichotomies of two worlds on the earth; one in which spirituality is the focus and in other materialism gains the prominence.</p>
			<p><strong>Is there an opportunity for a new educational order in India2035?</strong></p>
			<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, East and West seem to have followed different paths to attain education. I like to advance a theory that education of the modern times should serve the needs of both materialism and spirituality without the pains of dichotomies. Should such a system evolve, your generation of our civilization seems to me as the best suited one in the entire world of today. India-2035 seems to me as the most eligible location of the world from where a new education order might emerge for the “benefit of all”. In my view, there is an opportunity waiting to be availed. I need to justify my belief. Let me try and build my arguments from what I have seen recently.</p>
			<p><strong>World Cup 2011: Is it a mark of a new beginning?</strong></p>
			<p>India of 2035 will enjoy the benefit of youth energy, strong financial power, a vibrant market and confidence in the community. As we celebrated the other day on April 2, 2011 as a Nation, it became clear to me that it was not just a victory in an odd cricket match. It was about a Nation of 1.2 billion people wishing to reach the top and the 15 men delivering what the rest of the Nation wished for years, to be in the top of the world.</p>
			<p><strong>Hope in the Next Generation</strong></p>
			<p>The present generation of young people in India, bear a desire to accomplish and aspire to lead. My generation of Indians, in our childhood bore no evidence of aspirations. The one ahead of our generation of Indians was united in fight for political independence but it did not plan for a freedom from its own mental inhibitions and internal challenges. The generation of Indians graduating today in this convocation is different in both style and content in thought. You are built on the foundation of aspiration to grow and desire to lead. You are also descendents of a civilization which gave some unmatched leaders in the spiritual world. Buddha, Mahaveera, Adi Sankara, Gandhi and so many others gave this world a new definition for human life. They gave lessons that last centuries and gain in value every passing day in this planet. You, as Indians, possess the strength of legacy derived from the tallest of human souls and flexibility of modernity.</p>
			<p><strong>Challenge for the Next Generation</strong></p>
			<p>As we climb the ladder of success as a society, we will face challenges of sorts. It would need new educational systems. The power of education to counter the challenges of materialistic aggression in the world, where survival of the fittest is doctrine is one of the critical needs. The modern education system, fashioned along the way of the west, seems to provide the tools. This is an issue of adaptation to meet the challenges of global knowledge economy. However, when the society is facing an internal challenge of dichotomy, as a result of conflict between the systems of the past and systems for the future, there is a need to find ways and means of fusing the ethos of ancient educational system. Learning for knowledge rather than employment and wealth creating ability sub-merged social priority that raises its head often in different ways. Therefore, we need an educational system for this country that merges the best of both worlds.</p>
			<p><strong>India-2035: A Ground for New lessons</strong></p>
			<p>India-2035 will emerge as a testing ground for a system which ensures happiness of mind and comfort of the body. What will such an educational system are built upon? Such a system should build space for capturing the benefits of both spirit and power of education.</p>
			<p>Modern Information Technology tools enable access to vast body of information with reduced human effort. Information is a powerful tool in the emerging knowledge economy. Indians with their traditional strength of analytical power have emerged major global players in the IT world. The conversion of strength of individual Indians into the power of the country has demanded an important role for the private sector. Our IT companies in the private sector have demonstrated the strength of the country. Mysore hosts one of the most important centres in the world where human capacity is polished to meet the demands of global IT market. In other words, access to the power of education has been showcased for the world through our strength in applications of information technology.</p>
			<p><strong>India-2035: To Imbibe values from Spiritual and cultural heritage</strong></p>
			<p>India-2035 will have to be even stronger in areas where knowledge and expertise combine to produce products in global demand. Our demography offers rich dividends in these areas already and it is only to empower us even more strongly in the years to come. However, for enriching minds and the society, a mere strength in material world and economic power would not suffice. The world has learnt recently as to what a consumptive. civilization could lead to. Human greed is not satiable. Neither it is advisable to build a Nation on the strength of human greed. This would need an educational system which ensures sagacity and lessons from the ancient wisdom.</p>
			<p><strong>Call for focus on Universal Education</strong></p>
			<p>Imparting wisdom is neither easy nor possible from the classroom lessons alone. This calls for mentoring from people who live the lives of the learned. They are rare. They need not come from one generation. Lessons from the past from the days of Buddha are applicable today as they were at the time of Christ. Spirit of education is enshrined powerfully in the words of wisdom from our ancient scriptures, role-models and universal education. The challenge then to the Indian society is how to capture the lessons of the universal education in our modern educational institutions without recourses to Gurukul which defied scaling up and spreading the fruits of education to many?</p>
			<p><strong>Task ahead of Indian Universities: To build Ethicality in Education</strong></p>
			<p>In the endeavour of building an India where the education systems combine the benefits of both power and spirit of education, universities in India have an important and penetrating role to play. Instead of limiting themselves to the roles as degree awarding centres, where the knowledge is transacted for money, our universities should also become the nucleus for building a modern society carved out of an ancient civilization. University education cannot remain generally connected only to economics and get divested from the universal value of ethics and ethos. Indian education system should acquire potentials to build on the ethical value systems of the orient. There are lessons to learn from the experience of Nalanda and integrate the modern educational enterprises with the richness of mind-building.</p>
			<p><strong>Call for A National Movement for Value-based Education</strong></p>
			<p>What we need today is a National movement for an education for a resurgent Nation: Such a movement should be fuelled by an awakening of the society itself and not left only to the administrators of educational enterprises. A resurgent Nation like India could learn from the time-proven values of the past civilization. While the colonial powers might have fashioned the educational system in one way, what prevents us from reshaping it to suit the needs of the society of the future? We need social will and public policy support on the one hand and the burning desire of the learners to change the system to shape not only their own future but also the destiny of the world of tomorrow, on the other.</p>
			<p><strong>Next Best steps Forward</strong></p>
			<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, in my opinion, the Indian youth represented here in this hall today bears the burning fire in their hearts. Recent successes in some limited number of fields, whether be in sports or building fast breeder reactors or economic growth in harder times, should form the harbinger of what more can be accomplished in the India-2035. There are some surveys which rank India as the second of all Nations with respect to manufacturing competitiveness. There are predictions that India will be one of the most three powerful economies by 2035.</p>
			<p>The world expects India to rise and rise well above many. The resurgence of India is not in doubt. We will become a global economic power. Will we emerge as the global ethical power that we were once? You may recall the words of British General, when he talked of such moral values emanating from the rich spiritual and cultural heritage”. Will our university systems rise to inculcate values of spiritual and cultural heritage? The day is made when the universality of education imbibes the values of our heritage.</p>
			<p><strong>Call of Tagore through a Recall</strong></p>
			<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, this is what I meant as the “Education for the Resurgent Nation: The India-2035”. Let me conclude this address with the quote from the lecture of Tagore delivered on 26th May, 1921.</p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>“You know the traditions of our country are never to accept any material fees from the students in return to teaching, because we consider in India that one who has knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students".</em></p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>“We lost our confidence in our own civilization for over a century, when we came into contact with the western races with their material superiority over the Eastern Humanity and Eastern culture and in the educational establishments no provision was made for our own culture. And for over a century, our students have been brought up in utter ignorance of worth of their own civilization of the past. Thus we did not only lose the touch of the great which lay hidden in our own inheritance, but also the great honour of giving what we have; not merely begging from others, not merely borrowing culture and living like eternal school boys.</em></p>
			<p class="myquote"><em>But the time has come when we must not waste such our opportunities. We must try to do our best to bring out what we have, not go from century to century, from land to land and display our poverty before others. We know what we have to be proud of, what we have inherited from our ancestors and such opportunity of giving should not be lost not only for sake of our country but for the sake of Humanity”.</em></p>
			<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
			<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, time has come for India to rediscover herself. There is an inheritance that we need to invest upon. Let us all build together “The India-2035” into one where the head is held high and the heart of the Nation is rich with happiness. Let us build an India which is both an economic and the ethical power of the world. Such a destiny of this Nation is in the hands and heads of those who graduate today. To those women and men who will rewrite the history of India-2035 and make her glow, I bow in respect and wish you all a wonderful and purposeful life ahead.﻿</p>

			<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">NINETY-SECOND CONVOCATION ADDRESS </h1>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>By<br /> DR. D. PURANDESWARI<br /></strong> Hon'ble Union Minister of State for<br />Human Resource Development<br />Govt. of India (Higher Education)</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>April 7<sup>th</sup>, 2012﻿</em></p>
			<p><em>Sri D.V. Sadanandagowda, Hon'ble Chief Minister of Karnataka, and Pro-Chancellor of the University of Mysore, Prof. V.G. Talawar, Vice-Chancellor, Hon'ble Members of the Syndicate, Faculty Members and Students who will be securing the degrees and awards today.</em></p>
			<p>Ideem it a great privilege to deliver the 92nd Convocation Address of the University of Mysore. This occasion becomes all the more special, as the University would, in addition, award Honoris Causa to seven eminent personalities, namely Sri S.K. Shivakumar, Prof. P.V. Krishna Bhatta, Sri G. Madegowda, Dr. M. Govinda Rao, Smt. Jayanthi, Dr. Pavagada Prakash Rao and Sri C. Chandrashekara all of whom have made notable contributions in their respective fields.</p>
			<p>The University of Mysore has attained excellent achievements and earned a mark of great distinction and a high level of performance in the country. Great personalities like Sir Ashuthosh Mukherjee, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Prof. B.M. Srikantaiah, Prof. Rollo, Prof. S. Ramachandra Rao, Prof. A. N. Murthy Rao, Dr. K. V. Puttappa and a galaxy of other eminent professors who had taught in the university from time to time left an indelible impression of eminence and excellence of their ability and dedication. I find it difficult to mention all the names as the list is too big. I however pay my obeisance to all of them. I also express my deep sense of gratitude to the University authorities for inviting me to deliver the Convocation Address here to-day.</p>
			<p>At the outset, I convey my sincere good wishes and congratulations to all of them who by their dedicated efforts are getting their degrees and <em>Honoris</em> Causa today. I also convey my good wishes to all the parents who are here to see their wards graduating from this great university and receiving their degrees.</p>
			<p>From time immemorial, India has accorded highest importance to education as will be clear from the following verse of Bhartruhari the great king of Ujjain turned philosopher - cum-poet.</p>
			<p>विद्या नाम नरस्यरुपमाधिकं प्रच्छन्नगुप्तं धनम् विद्या भोगकरी यशः सुखकरी विद्या गुरूणां गुरुः ।<br /> विद्या बन्धुजनो विदेशगमने विद्या परं दैवतम् विद्या राजसु पूज्यते न हि धनं विद्याविहीनः पशुः ॥</p>
			<p>This means:<br /> “Education is special manifestation of man;</p>
			<p>Education is the treasure which can be preserved without any fear of loss;</p>
			<p>Education secures material pleasure, happiness and fame; Education is the teacher of the teachers; Education is the friend when one goes abroad;</p> 
			<p>Education is God incarnate;</p>
			<p>Education and not money secures honour and appreciation at the hands of the State;</p>
			<p> A man without education is nothing short of an animal.”</p>
			<p>This aspect of our civilization according supreme importance to education is also emphasized by the Supreme Court in the case of Mohini Jain Vs Union of India 1992 in which, while holding that right to education must be regarded as a fundamental right, the Court observed:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><strong>"Indian civilization recognizes education as one of the pious obligations of the human society. To establish and administer educational institutions is considered a religious and charitable object. Education in India has never been a commodity for sale”</strong></p>
			<p>Again in the case of Unnikrishnann Vs Union of India, 1993 in order to make out that the right to education constitutes part of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court maintained the importance of education as emphasized by Bhartruhari (which I have quoted above) and ruled that the “Right to Education" should be regarded as a fundamental right. This right which was till then regarded as only a Directive Principle was included as a Fundamental Right in Article 21-A in the Constitution pursuant to the above judgment.</p>
			<p>Despite these great ideas, we find that India today is a pale shadow of what it should have been. While, she should have led the world by these life-nurturing ideas; she is in fact being led by the crass materialism of others and she is being dehumanized by reckless consumerism of the rich and extreme penury and degrading passiveness of the poor. It appears that at one go humanity has been seized by those who believe that economic growth is the real index of both development and power and lasting index of human happiness. Never before in human history there came such a predicament when everything is being measured in terms of per capita income or GDP or the relative purchasing power or some such material considerations. This preoccupation on the part of the twenty-first century man has created a situation where family ties, inter personal, cultural, ethical, and even religious and social relations have been relegated to the background. Nobody to-day seems to be worried about the manner in which all finer graces of human civilization have ceased to receive priority attention from those who control our lives. On the contrary the mighty tides of consumerism and its mesmeric abilities are being whipped up to enslave the material part of human personality to ensure permanent dependence on, and help the emergence of, a new scenario of unlimited material growth. The spirited campaigns undertaken by the environmentalists against threat to global warming and environmental pollution and their request to prevent these harmful steps by the managers of our destiny receive only scant attention and unfortunately these warnings, by and large, still remain cries in the wilderness</p>
			<p>If we are really serious about peaceful and orderly development the galloping horses of humanity which are at the moment being whipped to run as fast as they could in order to win the heights of material success have to be reined in by the collective assertion of an awakened humanity which has a right to a danger free existence. A frightening aspect in to-day's growth scenario is the sad fact that man is nowhere in the reckoning now. He has been pitiably reduced to the status of a consumer; he is a consumer first and a consumer last. Similarly the purchasing power of a nation is all what the other nations now care for. The talk in the world capitals are all centered on as to which are the biggest markets in the world and newspapers everywhere devote bulk of their space for trends in stock markets, bullion rates, and their bullish/bearish tendencies.</p>
			<p>Mankind to-day is passing through an age of changing values with accent on materialism. Life has become an artificial embellishment. But when this mask is discarded by a single jostle of this rough world; darkness and mystery seem to pervade everywhere. We find today a weary world, shattered, battered, torn and shrunken with conflict and strife, desperately looking for a succour. The cultural erosion that is a menace to the present society is the byproduct of a spiritual aridity. This helpless condition must be changed. Societies must undergo transformation in a direction that the elements of societies understand and practice higher values of life. Education without spiritual content is the cause for the evils of society. Ignorance of the self has to be dispelled from the minds of the children by providing them the right guidance to differentiate the real from the transient. If the conscience of man is muddled, the ropes of rules and ethics cannot tie him because the spirit of all legality remains firmly grounded in the conscience of man. So education must aim at yielding honest and truthful individuals and this is possible only through moral education being imparted to our youth.</p>
			<p>Long years back Swami Vivekananda, the greatest patriot saint of India warned us:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><strong>“The mainspring of the strength of every race lies in its spirituality, and the death of that race begins the day that spirituality wanes and materialism gains ground”.</strong></p>
			<p>Our great national leaders like Tagore, and Gandhi also highlighted this deficiency in our educational system. Thoroughly rejecting the flawed colonial education system that was imposed upon Indian children, Tagore offered an alternative system. The western mode of education, he felt, was more harmful than helpful for us, as it steamrolled the children into artificial discipline, taught textbooks that were not so relevant to their needs and requirements and meant for children of an unfamiliar culture in an unfamiliar climate, and which forced them to learn too many things by rote without touching its base. It did not reflect the reality of the students' lives. The foreign dress code, for example, was unsuitable for a warm climate, it also kept them away from being in touch with nature and their natural surroundings. The poet felt that in India the colonial education system was imposed from above and the strong discipline in the schools was based on fear, not on sympathy. The mechanically imposed system did not take account bf the individual student's state of mind or body, on the contrary it forced its rules upon them, ultimately dampening their spirits and killing their initiatives. Instead of liberating and enriching the mind, this mindless colonial education chained it, separated it from its natural surroundings, robbed the joy of life, thus ultimately defeating the very purpose of education.</p>
			<p>Education, Tagore felt, should allow us to welcome fresh air into our closed spaces, and break down artificial barriers, and real differences among mankind should be recognized and not glossed over, nor bulldozed into oneness. It needed emotional and intellectual sympathy and cooperation, which the poet believed, was the sole object of human civilization. Without intellectual sympathy one race could never understand the problems of another. The British system of education in India, according to him, lacked emotional as well as intellectual sympathy. According to Tagore, education could not be complete unless it was based on one's cultural or social moorings.</p>
			<p>Similarly, Gandhiji was an ardent supporter of a fully educated citizen. His educational philosophy can be summarized in the following cardinal postulates:</p>
			<p>1. Education means all round development; which is best obtained through action.</p>
			<p>2. Education has to be achieved through a craft, and not merely through books and abstractions.</p>
			<p>3. The basis of true education is character building so that an educated person could become an ideal citizen.</p>
			<p>4. Education should be self-supporting as far as possible and should equip the pupil to better his own economic conditions.</p>
			<p>5. All educational planning should be undertaken with the rural Indian masses in mind; in other words, education should not be elitist, but popular in its character.</p>
			<p>Quoting Huxley, Gandhiji used to say that that person is properly educated “whose body is the ready servant of his will, whose intellect is clear, whose mind is stored with a knowledge of fundamental truths of nature and whose passions are trained to come to heel by a vigorous will”. Gandhiji advocated that our educational system should be such as to make the students "true representatives of our culture, civilization and of true genius of our nation”. He considered the character-building as an essential ingredient in our educational system which is also what Swami Vivekananda had emphasized decades before him.</p>
			<p>These educational ideas, founded as they are on certain eternal principles, have not lost their relevance even to-day. Gandhiji had emphasized that we should draw up a self-supporting educational system, which would improve the lot of the poorest of the poor and that such an education should be based on action, problem-solving and practical activity, rather than mere book learning. His idea was of an integral education, which allowed the whole being of a person to grow, an education which emphasized character-building and cultural identity.</p>
			<p>It is often said that Gandhiji was opposed to modern ideas especially from the West. His letter to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is an emphatic contradiction of this popular misconception Iquote a few lines from the letter:</p>
			<p class="myquote">"I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture and teachings of all the lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible, but I refuse to be swept off my feet. I also refuse to live in other people's house as an interloper, a beggar or a slave”.</p>
			<p>Gandhiji was never against advancement in technology as is erroneously believed but he was against any technology which denigrated human beings. He was not against large entrepreneurship but was against profiteering as a basic motive in large-scale production. To-day an understanding has developed in the corporate world that mere profit motive would not help them in the long run to attain optimum production. They are now therefore talking about inclusive growth and social responsibility and gradually are beginning to understand that benefits like better health care, subsidized housing schemes etc are likely to motivate labours to put in unstinted efforts in their work.</p>
			<p>Before I end, I would like to a quote a few lines from the observation made by Swami Vivekananda as to the true purpose of education:</p>
			<p class="myquote"><strong>“We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one's own feet.”</strong></p>
			<p>We must realize that in the entire educational system, intellect and intuition, science and spirituality, living and learning have to be promoted in a balanced manner. Character is the foundation upon which rises the spiritual edifice. As long as one is a slave of the senses, talk of spirituality is a mockery. There are millions of educated men and women in our free India today, but many of them are inwardly not free. The external devices cannot bring about the psychological understanding and the ethical unity that are essential for the happiness of humanity. If the idea of revival is to become the future goal of mankind's pursuit for peace and happiness, it will be possible only when we are ready to build it on the plane of mind and with all the appliances of technology which are available to us to implement that psychological and spiritual revival. Spiritual education is the only solution that can be offered to alleviate and even eliminate the leaping flames of world tensions that are threatening to consume humanity on various counts. Only then we can breathe that celestial vital air of lasting peace and happiness and only then we can replace the current culture of casualness, callousness, corruption and conceit by the culture of care, compassion, catholicity and commitment.</p>
			<p>With these words, I have great pleasure in delivering this 92nd Convocation Address in this great University.</p>

			<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">NINETY-THIRD CONVOCATION ADDRESS</h1>
			<p class="text-center">By<br /><strong>DR. M. M. PALLAM RAJU</strong><br />Hon'ble Union Minister for<br /> Human Resource Development<br /> Govt. of India (Higher Education)</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>July 5<sup>th</sup>, 2013﻿</em></p>
			<p><strong><em>Your Excellency,</em></strong></p>
			<p>The Governor of Karnataka and the Chancellor of the University of Mysore Sri Hansraj Bhardwaj, Hon'ble Higher Education Minister of Karnataka and Pro- Chancellor of the University of Mysore Sri R.V. Deshapande, the Vice-Chancellor Prof. K.S. Rangappa, Members of the Syndicate and the Academic Council, distinguished personalities who are bestowed today with Honorary Doctorate, Deans of Faculty, Heads of Department, Faculty, Parents and members of the faculties, students, representatives of the media, guests, distinguished citizens, friends, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
			<p>I deem it an honour to deliver the Ninety Third Convocation Address of the prestigious University of Mysore, whose reputation as a premiere institution of learning has spread far and wide. The happy coincidence is that the Centenary Year is fast approaching and the University is sitting pretty winning the most coveted accreditation from the Apex Body of Assessment. Convocation day is a milestone in the life of the students as well as in the annals of the University's history. Because so many young men and women move from a lower order of intellectual zone to a higher order of inquiry, though it is not visible to the outside world, the students invariably register that progress in the fine calibration that takes place within them and it resembles the vital sap moving upwards filling the minutest capillaries of the trunk and the branches and twigs of the tree. That vital juice is the knowledge the young men and women have made their own during the course of their training here in the University.</p>
			<p>Graduation day is also an occasion to thank one's teachers who with their dedicated service have enabled their wards to discover new horizons of experience through scholarly pursuit. And therefore, it is a moment of rejoicing for both the teachers, pupils and researchers.</p>
			<p><strong>Education is the Way</strong></p>
			<p>Education has been defined in very many ways down the ages. All definitions point in one direction, more or less; that is in the direction of seeking light where darkness abounds. Education is something that cannot be transferred from one generation to the next automatically and by some subterfuge. It has to be earned with great and sincere effort by each generation. Earning education is a liberating process, so much so that the preeducation days of an individual are shrouded in haze and darkness and post-education phases are bright and effulgent.</p>
			<p><strong>Education and Culture</strong></p>
			<p>I don't have to dwell too much on this aspect of culture, because Mysore is legitimately known as the “cultural capital of Karnataka”. And this sobriquet is not earned just like that. There is a sturdy legacy behind it. The credit must go to various enlightened dynasties that have ruled over Karnataka, which culminated, perhaps, with the Vijayanagar Empire, which was guided by the redoubtable King Krishnadevaraya, who has enriched the cultural life of both Andhra and Karnataka and thus we are the joint-inheritors of that undimmed legacy.</p>
			<p>Those who have marshalled this University in modern times include Sir Ashutosh Mukherji, Brajendranath Seal, the Maharaja of Mysore, Sir M. Visvesvaraya, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Dr. K.V. Puttappa, to name only a few. Because of their comprehensive vision and unalloyed benevolence the University enjoyed uniform flourishing in its formative years. His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore, especially, placed a lot of emphasis on reaching education to the common people thereby reminding the foremost duty of a people's University. Eversince, the succeeding guides have kept this fundamental obligation to people in view and have made genuine attempts to live up to the expectation.</p>
			<p>Delivering the First Convocation address in 1918, Sir Ashutosh Mukherji has drawn our attention to very important aspects of life. Keeping the interests of the new graduates he says: “You have promised to your University, symbolized in your Chancellor, to the utmost of your opportunity and ability, you will support and promote the cause of morality and sound learning, and you will uphold and advance social order and the well-being of your fellow-men"</p>
			<p>If you take note of the salient features of all the Convocation Addresses so far, you will notice that the learned Guests have reiterated again and again that the educated people in our society must make a difference. They must lead the not so fortunate brethren on the path of virtue and morality. My task is to remind you that your commitment to the right cause is imperative because we have already taken a pledge to work for the nation. When our obligation is so comprehensive we need to think of life as a holistic concept.</p>
			<p><strong>Improvement of Quality of Life</strong></p>
			<p>We have made substantive progress since our Independence on all fronts. But there is room for improvement, in the sense, that we have not been able to wipe out hunger completely; we have not provided shelter to all and we have not achieved 100% literacy throughout the country. As long as we don't achieve these targets so long we will not rise in the estimation of the comity of nations. It is a good sign that many nations of the world look up to us for guidance and are eager to take a leaf out of our experience in achieving progress and prosperity. But that should not make us complacent and self-satisfied. Our ancient rshis always exhorted us to “march on and march forward. We need to hear those words of vigil, because the population of our country is growing exponentially and swallowing all the gains we have made as a gift of science and technology.</p>
			<p><strong>The Role of the University in such a Scenario</strong></p>
			<p>Pandit Jawarhalal Nehru has said the most memorable thing about the role of the University thus, “The University stands for humanism, for tolerance, for reason, for the adventure of ideas and for the search of truth. It stands for the onward march of the human race towards even higher objectives. If the universities discharge their duties adequately, then it is well with the nation and the people”.</p>
			<p>Pandit Nehru has reminded us about the enormous responsibility a University has to shoulder in order to guide the society out of the quagmire of confusion and the clutter caused by entities working at cross-purposes.</p>
			<p>Pandit Nehru expected so much from the Universities because he was aware that the “Universities are repositories of knowledge. Knowledge of life and knowledge for life which together sustain civilizations. Knowledge enlightens, emancipates, empowers and transforms. What is expected of knowledge to make the weak and the meek more strong and articulate and to make the strong and the articulate more just and fair, more caring and sharing."</p>
			<p><strong>Higher Education and its Goal</strong></p>
			<p>In view of the enlightened ideas expressed by the savants of humanity regarding education and its primary purpose, it can be inferred that higher education does not stop at knowledge alone, it goes beyond and embraces wisdom. What is wisdom, then? It is the ability to discriminate and decide between right and wrong. The objective of higher education is to inculcate such wisdom. It is wisdom that guides us to go beyond material wealth in order to realize the fundamental objective of human pursuit.</p>
			<p>John Ruskin, the great nineteenth century British thinker has given us the definition of a richest country: “The richest country is that which nourishes the greatest number of happy human beings.” That should be our aim and goal. We have not realized this as yet. All our efforts must be galvanised in accomplishing this objective. If this is our undislodgeable aim then there is no room for dichotomy between Science and Humanities; since both of them strive to explore the possibilities of tracing the allencompassing dimensions of human life. Therefore, one cannot be imagined without the other. With this end in view these two wings must work in tandem to produce the desired results.</p>
			<p>I congratulate all the graduates who have obtained their degrees, the medalists and prize winners, and the elders who have been bestowed the Honoris Causa in this convocation for rendering distinguished service in various walks of life. A word to the young graduates, among whom some would pursue higher degrees and others would take up some professions. The education you have received from this hallowed University will definitely form the intellectual bank balance all through your life. And I would gently remind you to augment this bank balance so that the dividend could be shared with others and thus the benefactions you have received would be transferred to a larger society. This would enlarge the ring of goodwill in society and ultimately the whole community would rise to a higher order of existence. I am sure you are going to realize these lofty objectives in your life time and that will be the greatest gift you would offer to the nation. My best wishes to you.</p>

			<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">NINETY-FOUR CONVOCATION ADDRESS </h1>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>By<br /> DR. SAM PITRODA Advisor</strong><br /> to the Prime Minister on<br /> Public Information, Infrastructure &#38;<br />Innovation, New Delhi</p>
			<p class="text-center"><em>March 22<sup>nd,</sup> 2014﻿</em></p>
			<p><em>His Excellency, the Chancellor, Sri Hansraj Bhardwaj, Hon'ble Vice Chancellor, Prof. Rangappa, distinguished colleagues on the dais, faculty and students, friends from India, distinguished guests, ladies and gentleman.</em></p>
			<p>Good afternoon. It is indeed a special honour and privilege for me to be here with you to deliver the 94th Convocation Address. I thank the organizers for giving me this opportunity. It is good to be in this beautiful city and this great University and I hope you celebrate your 100 years with great deal of festivity. First I want to thank the University, Hon'ble Vice Chancellor, his Excellency, the Chancellor, for the Honoris Causa degree. I am indeed honored and privileged and I cherish this forever. I want to congratulate two of my colleagues, D. Mahadeva and C. Gowda, for the Honorary Degree. I want to congratulate all the graduating students for their success and I want to wish them a great journey going forward. I can't help but notice that in this list of 216 people who received medals 140 are girls and I am proud of the fact that India is paying attention to the education of the girls. When I graduated 52 years ago with my first college degree in Physics, I must tell you, there were very few girls in Engineering, Medicine and Science. So I am really proud of all of you and I want you to know that we have come a long way as a nation.</p>
			<p>We are a young nation as we got our Independence just in 1947. I was a young boy. When I was growing up the patriotic fervour of our founding fathers, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel was still in the air and in my mind we formulated the kind of India that they had envisioned. The India that is inclusive, India that is democratic, India that is concerned about poor, and those at the bottom of the pyramid, India that is really for everybody. We have come a long way in this journey. Believe me at the time of independence we had very little. Our colonial masters had essentially robbed us. India was the largest economy in 1760, at 37%, at the time of Independence, Indian economy was 2% of the world economy and we had to build everything from scratch, literally. So, our founding fathers paid attention to higher education, science and technology; built institutions like IITs, IIMs, Universities, laboratories, atomic energy, space research, agriculture research, medical research, CSIR. But it took a long long time to see the visible benefits. The journey has been very complicated. I wanted you to know that in the last 10 years we have done a great deal for education, for youth and women. Unfortunately, in all these media noise signal gets lost; and in all this confusion the impression being created is that we have not done anything. Let me give you some simple examples of what we have done.</p>
			<p>In 2004, right after the UPA-1 Government was formed, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh decided to set up a National Knowledge Commission. I had the fortune to Chair the National Knowledge Commission, where we looked at the knowledge institution and infrastructure India would need in the 21st Century. We spent four years with distinguished experts in every field, with domain experts to really layout a road-map; we looked at access to knowledge, knowledge concepts, knowledge creation, knowledge applications and the role of knowledge in the governance. We looked at some 27 different subjects. We had over 1000 people working on it nation-wide and we put together a blueprint and a road map. The main concern was that if we are to grow at 8% to 10% year for the next 20-25 years to come we would need human talent. We just don't have the kind of talent we need. We need more doctors, more engineers, more scientists, more mathematicians, more plumbers, more electricians and the shortages are all over. So we laid out our plan in a very detailed manner. Some of those things got done, some didn't get done. We fail in some of these areas to execute partly because of coalition government, partly because of internal conflicts and partly because of the mindset. Because we ask for generational change; we ask for structural reforms; we ask for using technology, to really change learning models. These are very different ideas. Today our mindset is locked up in the past. We still believe it is required to get four years to get a degree. We still believe you need teacher to teach. And our message was technology, especially, Web and Internet have changed everything. It has essentially changed learning model. So all you need is motivation, time and talent.</p>
			<p>You do need a teacher, but you need a teacher as a mentor. But, most of our teachers are not trained to be mentors. In 2004, 10% of our children could go to college. In 2014, 20% of our children in India can go to college. Double the number of children are going to college, and people tell me nothing got done. They are just not willing to listen. I say many times that we have outsourced our thinking, and we are not thinking for ourselves. We have built many more colleges, Universities; we are creating five institutes for medicines like, AIIMS. We have so many National Universities, Central Universities. We are creating 12 design institutions and the list goes on and on and on. Everywhere in education we have focused on expansion, excellence and equity. We have to make sure that the poorest of the poor can indeed get the best education possible.</p>
			<p>Education is empowering; education is very redefining. I got out of poverty, and ignorance only because of education. I am a son of a carpenter. People don't know that, because I am now an engineer, scientist, computer expert, TELECOM engineer. My father had fourth grade education. Education changed not only my life but changed my entire family. Everyone of my brothers and sisters went to college, Universities, went to US, settled there; my parents came to there; because that was the way to get out of the poverty then. Today opportunities in India are just unlimited. There is so much going on in this country. But, you need to take charge of your own destiny. Today, India offers lots and lots of opportunities. As you know we have been growing at the rate of 8% for 8 years out of 10. It's only during last two years our growth has gone down a little bit to 5% but which is pretty good, and I guaranty that we will continue to grow at 8 to 10% for next 20-25 years to come; because we have no options. We have 550 million young people below the age of 25, we got to provide food, nutrition, skill, education, hope, jobs, to all of them. We need to create 10-15 million new jobs every year, year after year. Where are these jobs going to come from? These jobs will not come from government. They will come from entrepreneurs, coming out of colleges and Universities like this. You will have to create jobs and not take jobs away from people. You are fortunate enough to have the kind of education you need. I have been saying that I am very high on India mainly because we have a very great opportunity in terms of technology. Technology today offers a unique way to solve problems, problems related to people at the bottom of the pyramid. Our entire focus has to be on inclusive. The challenge is not to create more billionaires, but the challenge is to lift 300 to 400 million people below poverty line into the mainstream. To do that, we need a lot of young talent to work for the poor; to work to solve the problems using different technology and tools and it is not just IT and communication, software and computers. But, it is about Biotech, nanotech, materials, microbiology, stemcell research, genetics, alternative energy and a lot more. Today, world over every year, we introduce 70 billion microprocessors. Today 10 microprocessors per human being today is introduced in the market. What do these things do? Who programs them? This is the kind of future you will have to build. When I started my work in India on TELECOM, we had 2 million telephones. It used to take 10-15 years to get a telephone connection. Somebody just gave me a little cartoon by Laxman painted where Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is getting a tour of the exhibition and the officer says to Prime Minister: "This is our new model in the exhibition. It is a telephone, by the way it is also working”, That was supposed to be a joke in 1985. Today, in a short span of 35 years we have gone from 2 million phones to 900 million phones.</p>
			<p>We are a people of a connected billion. How do we use this connectivity going forward is the challenge. So we are building new infrastructure. We have built a National Knowledge Network; I am sure Mysore University is connected to it, where we have 1500 node and with 40 gigabyte bandwidth to connect all our Universities, all our libraries, all our research and development institutions to improve research, teaching and collaboration; because, all research today is multi-disciplinary all research requires a great deal of team work and collaboration and all research is happening faster than ever before. So we need new tools and the government has spent 2 million dollars in building this network. Nobody knows, nobody, nobody talks about it, media doesn't cover it. So when people say nothing got done, let me tell you, they are essentially ignorant. Now we are building a network to connect 250 thousand panchayats to optical fiber that will get done in the next 18 months so that every village will have huge broadband capacity to transform education, health, public service, agriculture, governance, financial system, with this we are creating platforms like Nandan Nilekani's working on ID, Dr. Kasthuri Rangan is working on GIS. We are building application platform computerizing codes. The Hon'ble Governor, was Minister of Law and a lot of his work started during his tenure. We have 32 million court cases pending. We are computerizing police, computerizing prison and we are really creating infrastructure for the young generation to do things differently. But a lot of these take time; these things don't happen overnight. We introduced Right to Information, we introduced Right to Education, we introduced Food Security Bill. All of these , things are landmark decisions. And these things take decades to yield results.</p>
			<p>I always remind everybody that building a company is very different from building a nation. We are building a nation and building a nation requires patience, understanding, consensus, time, energy. These things don't happen overnight. But we need support of the people in building a nation. By bickering and criticizing each other you don't build a nation. You need to build a nation through hard work, long-term vision, commitment to the future; a lot of this stuff is going on. We need to empower our young with new tools so they begin to solve problems very differently than we solved. They are going to be working on microbiology, stem-cell research, genetics, big data, smart cities, censors; they will be designing cars which don't require drivers. They will live far into the future to build new kind of cities; because our cities will not make sense to them and I am confidant that young Indian talent will deliver provided we let them do things; provided seniors back off and provided you turn over systems to our young</p>
			<p>Before coming here I gave two talks-one at the Vivekananda School and the other one at the Jagadguru School and my message was that we really need to let our young do their thing. Indian parents are too nosy. They interfere too much and my message to young people is that there are two groups of people you should never listen to; one your parents and two your teachers. Because they are basically obsolete. What happened in the last 20 years has changed everything. Their tools are so very different from the tools you are going to be using; we don't even understand some of these tools. This morning I gave this example and I will give it again: I have a three-year-old granddaughter. She lives in San Francisco and she Skype's me every day and then she would say “Dada, you are frozen because there is no bandwidth”. It is that generation that you need to keep in focus. All these kids know how to operate complicated cell phones and smart phones and TVs. Their reflexes are very different from mine. They are very comfortable with the unknown and if we turn over our future to them, they will design the future that they think it is right for them. What we think is right and wrong is no longer right and wrong for them. They need to innovate and this government has paid great deal of attention to innovation. We have introduced national innovation councils, state-level councils, sectoral councils, innovations and clusters, 'Thod-PhodJhod' centers in schools; billion-dollar-innovation fund to fund innovations at the bottom of the pyramid and all of that.</p>
			<p>We are indeed building Knowledge Society and for knowledge society you need knowledge workers. You are the knowledge workers of tomorrow and we need to build on your knowledge in new knowledge. We cannot take the western model of development; we need to create Indian model of development, which is really focused on affordability, scalability and sustainability. India is indeed at a tipping point. Next 10 to 20 years are going to define the kind of India we are going to be in. These 60 years have given us time to build basic infrastructure; the next 20 will decide how we take off and at times I worry because basic idea of India is being challenged by many. The idea of democracy, the idea of focus on inclusion, the idea of science is being challenged and we need to really keep our focus on the Gandhian model of development.</p>
			<p>I grew up with understanding of truth, simplicity, sacrifice, self-reliance, concern for the minority, concern for the underprivileged, rural development, and all of these were Indian notions and we need to use modern technology to develop Indian model of development which focuses on Gandhian ideals and not just take western ideas lock, stock and barrel and build a consumeroriented society. The consumption-based model from the West is not scalable, workable, sustainable, desirable for India. We need to really create a new model and I find that the talent in the South is so very important to India. Bangalore is what Bangalore is because Bangalore had the great institutions of learning; Bangalore had the institutional infrastructure. Mysore can be tagged on to Bangalore Knowledge Infrastructure because Bangalore has expanded too much, become too congested, takes an hour and a half to get anywhere. If we focus on this part of the country to build right kind of knowledge-base, I think, you can really begin to solve the problems of the country very differently. Going forward means that we need to focus on technology and young talent it also necessitates the reform our systems. We need administrative reforms, political reforms, judiciary reforms, financial reforms. labour reforms; we need further liberalization, privatization, globalization, because of a lot of our system were designed by British Raj and we are now complicating it, computerizing it and it won't work. We need new processes to reflect new reality. We need more power, energy, we need to create more jobs, we need to improve infrastructure. There is enough work cut out in this country for the next 50 years. But it will require hard work, long hours, great deal of innovation and good government. I believe destiny of this country will be dictated in the next decade. On one hand, I am very optimistic; on the other hand, I am concerned a little bit. If we keep our focus on the core idea of India and Gandhian values and the wisdom of our founding fathers, Pandit Nehru, Sardar Patel and others, I think, we will build India that we all would be proud of.</p>
			<p>With this I want to once again thank His Excellency the Hon'ble Chancellor and Hon'ble Vice-Chancellor for giving me this opportunity. I want to once again congratulate all the graduating students and wish them a great journey going forward.</p>
			<p class="text-center"><strong>Thank you all﻿</strong></p>
