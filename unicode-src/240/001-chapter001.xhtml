		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Speech delivered at the First<br /> Corivocation of the University of Mysore on <br />19th October 1918 by His Highness <br />The Maharaja of Mysore, Chancellor.</h1>
		<p>MR.VICE-CHANCELLOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>It was with great pride and pleasure that I presided two years ago at the First Meeting of the Senate of the Mysore University, and it gives me even more gratification to attend this, our First Convocation, which will always be remembered as a land-mark in the history of Education in Mysore.</p>
		<p>On the last occasion that I addressed you I referred to the circumstances which led to the foundation of our University and to the hopes and ambitions which I entertained for its future. It is satisfactory to find from the Annual Report of the University that the ideals referred to in my address have been steadily kept in view. During the past two years the University has enlarged its activities by instituting the degrees of Commerce and Engineering, and proposals are under consideration for starting other Faculties.﻿</p>
		<p>I am gratified to learn that both the Engineering College and the Commerce classes have attracted a large number of students, more in fact than we could afford to admit. This is a healthy sign indicating an appreciation on the part of the public of the business and technical side of education.</p>
		<p>Considerable additions have been made to the teaching and professorial staff of the University, and I am glad that we have succeeded in securing the services of Professors of known ability and high qualifications.</p>
		<p>It is my earnest desire that the higher education of women should be increasingly developed, and I wish that I could have seen not one, but ten lady graduates before mre to-day. I look forward to the time when every district in Mysore will be supplied with trained lady graduate teachers.</p>
		<p>Our University attaches great importance to the study of the vernaculars which are made compulsory throughout the course, and the Publication Bureau is doing very useful work in encouraging the publication of books written in good idiomatic "Kannada". I am particularly interested, too, in the means which are being adopted to enourage the study of Sanskrit. The Sanskrit Library, which is under a re-organized Committee, will find fuller scope for its activities when it enters into possession of the new building now under construction, I trust that the University will do all in its power to foster the study of our mother-tongue and of Sanskrit, two languages which must always command the sympathy and interest of all educated Mysoreans.﻿</p>
		<p>The lectures under the University Extension Scheme have so far been confined to the two university centres of Mysore and Bangalore, and I am glad to find that the work is now being extended to the interior of Mysore. This is, I think, a very important development, for it is to the remote parts of the State, which have not the educational advantages of our two capital cities, that we should specially direct our efforts with a view to introducing a higher standard of culture among the people.</p>
		<p>I attach the highest importance to a proper Tutorial System in this University, and I understand that a serious effort is being made to introduce a Tutorial Scheme. The problem is a difficult one.</p>
		<p>I am particularly interested in the housing of the University students, and it is satisfactory to find that the University realizes its responsibility in this matter. The buildings and conveniences of the Maharaja's College Hostel have been recently extended, and I hope that no time will be lost in providing further accommodation for the students of the Central and Engineering Colleges at Bangalore. Many of our students cannot afford to live in the hostels, and an endeavour should be made to establish cheap messing houses in suitable localities for such students.</p>
		<p>Education should not be confined to intellectual effort. Its physical, moral and social aspects should receive their due attention even in a teaching University. The erection of Union buildings both here and at Bangalore is an important step in this direction, and I hope that some workable﻿ scheme of physical culture, with voluntary medical inspection, may be shortly introduced. A cricket pavilion has been built at Mysore, and I hope that a Swimming Bath will before long give our students a new form of exercise and recreation.</p>
		<p>But even more significant than all the signs of activity and progress which I have touched on, is the fact that the Mysore University has been exceedingly jealous in maintaining the high standard of its examinations, and that its authorities realize the importance of appointing outside examiners.</p>
		<p>In our enthusiasm for our University we must not forget that its efficiency largely depends on the schools which serve as its feeders. Already our University is trying to improve these institutions by setting a high standard for the Entrance Examination, by prescribing the curricula of the collegiate classes, and by their inspection and general supervision. My Government have only recently sanctioned very generous grants for the better equipment of their important classes.</p>
		<p>There is, unfortunately, a limit to the resources which my Government can afford to place at the disposal of the University. The cost of higher education is steadily increasing, and if educational opportunities are to be open to all my subjects and not confined to the richer classes only, public support must be forthcoming in an ever increasing degree. I am glad to learn that during the short period of its existence, the University has evoked the spontaneous﻿ liberality of many public-spirited citizens, and has received endowments to the value of over one lakh of rupees.</p>
		<p>It is a gratifying fact that we have been able to hold our First Convocation at the actual seat of our University, and in the centre of those new buildings which are a tangible proof of our earnest desire to make the Mysore University a complete and fully equipped seat of learning.</p>
		<p>It is only fitting that I should refer on this public occasion to the wonderful succession of victories which are crowning the arms of the British and Indian armies and their allies in the terrible war which has hung like a cloud over the civilized world for over four years. Thank God the cloud is lifting, and a victory in the cause of justice and liberty seems to be actually in sight. But though the cloud of war is showing a silver lining, we are, I grieve to say, passing through a dark period of adverse season and epidemic disease which cannot but sadden us all. The monsoon has failed in many parts of the State, and the prolonged drought and war conditions have raised the cost of the necessaries of life to famine prices, Added to this, a severe influenza epidemic has appeared and raised the mortality to alarming proportions. I appeal to the public to fight the scourage with courage by means of effective local organization and mutual help. I have directed that no expenditure should be stinted, or efforts spared, on measures of relief, so far as they lie in the power of my Government; and I may assure the people that my own thoughts are constantly with them in their sufferings and bereavements.</p>
		<p>I feel that I should acknowledge on this public occasion a debt of gratitude from myself and my people to Sir M. Visvesvaraya, the Dewan of my State. It was chiefly his patriotism, his enthusiasm, and his 'unflinching advocacy which converted, what was once little more than a dream of the future into a living creation, and his name will always be remembered, above all others, as the man to whom our University owes its being.</p>
		<p>I will not detain you by any long words of exhortation addressed to those who have received the hall-mark of a University degree to-day. That duty I can leave with perfect confidence to my guest Sir Asutosh Mookerjee who, at much sacrifice of time and trouble, has given testimony to his unflagging interest in the cause of University education by consenting to come to Mysore and address you. I need hardly tell him how very grateful I feel to him, and how highly I appreciate his presence here to-day. I would like, however, to give you graduates one thought to carry away with you, by quoting some eloquent words used by Mr. Asquith in a Rectorial Address to the students of the University of Aberdeen :</p>
		<p>"Keep always with you, whereever your course may lie, the best and most enduring gift that a University can bestow - the company of great thoughts, the inspiration of great ideals, the example of great failures - so equipped you can face without perturbation the buffets of circumstance, the caprice of fortune, all the inscrutable vicissitudes of life."</p>
		<p>I will now call upon Sir Asutosh Mookerjee to address the graduates.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the First Convocation<br /> of the University of Mysore on 19th October<br /> 1918 by Sir Asutosh Mookerjee, late<br /> Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta.</h1>
		<p class="text-center">YOUR HIGHNESSES, MR. VICE-CHANCELLOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>I feel deeply embarrassed as I look round this distinguished gathering of representatives of the intellect and aristocracy of the most progressive of Indian States beyond the limits of British India. The invitation to address you, issued under the direction of His Highness the Chancellor, by your first citizen, whom it is a privilege to know and respect, was couched in such terms of courtesy and cordiality that ready acceptance was inevitable. Apart from this, refusal was really inconceivable, as the invitation had emanated from a Ruling Prince, whose high character, judged by the most exacting standards, had called forth the deepest feelings of reverence and admiration from all who had ever the good fortune to come into contact with him, and who so fittingly enjoyed the unique distinction of uniting in himself the dignified office of Chancellor in two Indian Universities. I am not ashamed, however, to make the frank confession that ever since my acceptance of your kind invitation, I have regretted my rashness, and have repeatedly wished that I had not shouldered so serious a responsibility. But as duty once undertaken, even though thoughtlessly, can never be declined, I can only claim your generous indulgence, while I detain you with a few brief﻿ observations on the question now foremost in the mind of every member of this assembly - what should be the guiding principles of this newly founded University, which will be consecrated in years to come by the loyal and loving allegiance of successive generations of Mysoreans, how will her imperative needs be met so as to place and keep her, the equal of the greatest, the peer of the noblest, the progressive world of science, letters and art ?</p>
		<p>Do not imagine for a moment that I shall be so unwise as to hazard a definition of a University, a task which has baffled many an acute scholar and cultured administrator. They have asked, from time to time, what is a University, and have found themselves at sea. Is it a set of fine buildings? Is it an educational institution which has beneficent patrons and has secured the gift of a million ? Is it an aggregate of four Faculties? Is it a scholastic guild ? Is it a society of masters? Is it an assembly of students ? Is it an examining body authorized to grant degrees? Is it a corporation of individuals who investigate the unknown, but neither teach nor test? Is it a combination of colleges without religion? Is it an association of teaching institutions without a curriculum? Must it possess all or any of these characteristics? Or is it, as Samuel Johnson inspired, perhaps, by his boundless knowledge of things ancient and modern, boldly enunciated in the first edition of his famous Dictionary, a school where all the arts and faculties are taught and studied, or is this merely a stimulating but impossible ideal formulated﻿ by that profoundly learned Doctor ? Blame me not, if I deem it needless, for our present purposes, to seek a definitive solution of these puzzles.</p>
		<p>Let us provisionally assume as correct the description that a University is a corporation of teachers and students, banded together in the pursuit of learning and for the expansion of the bounds of knowledge. A University thus constitutes the visible manifestation of the activities of the State in the domain of the highest grades of education for the benefit of the people. From this standpoint, we realize the supreme importance of two fundamental principles. In the first place, a University can achieve the complete fulfilment of its purpose, only if at the time of its foundation, it is adapted to the special needs and circumstances of the people whom it is designed to serve. In the second place, a University will retain its vitality and usefulness unimpaired, only if it ever continues to be wisely articulated to the true requirements of the community, if its governors sedulously watch the ever varying needs of the people from time to time, from generation, and mould and develop their institution accordingly. These principles, so formulated, cannot be successfully challenged, and may almost bear the semblance of unimportant platitudes.</p>
		<p>But though it has been often asserted that all Universities cannot be expected to be uniform in character and cast in the same mould, yet, in this continent, when a new University is created or an existing University is reconstructed, the attempt is repeatedly made to model﻿ it on the pattern of a University in another country, organized under very dissimilar conditions and flourishing in entirely different surroundings. The oft-repeated axiom is, in this sphere, apt to be ignored or overlooked, that you cannot completely westernize the East any more than you can fundamentally easternize the West. The demand may thus legitimately be made that when Universities are constituted in India - and we anxiously look forward to the day when they will multiply in number and increase in vigour-they will not be unintelligent and uncritical imitations of educational institutions elsewhere. Explore the conditions patiently, sympath.cally, dispassionately, and then your constitution with courage, even though the frame result be unlike ancient and venerable foundations which shed lusture on other climes.</p>
		<p>But when the Universities have been so constituted as the result of independent enquiry and judgement, their utility would be seriously affected, nay their purpose would be ultimately defeated, if they were to lose thier elasticity and assume a form stereotyped for ever. Fetters they have not imposed upon them in their inception; shackles they shall not forge for themselves in the course of their career. The history of many a famous University, however, affords convincing proof that the dangers of extreme conservatism are by no means imaginary. Universities, as they grow, acquire traditions, sometimes the product of centuries, which tend to enchain them to the past. The imperative call of the ever-changing needs of the people﻿ who cannot escape the operation of world-forces, doubtless compels the Universities from time to time to review their ideals, to revise their methods, to extend the horizon of their activities, to answer the challenge thrown out to them by the voice of progress; but the general tendency has been a pathetic adherence to old ideals and a reluctant recognition of the claims of the insistent present. This has favoured the creation of new and potent educational agencies, the foundation of new Universities, in response to new demands of diverse kinds- their scope and character largely shaped, the lines of their activities deeply influenced by the circumstances which called them forth into existence. Problems of compulsory Greek and obligatory Sanskrit seem veritably insoluble, while the modern sciences, which have silently revolutionized the life of humanity, and profoundly affected its hopes, ideals and aspirations, patiently await academic patronage in the ante-room.</p>
		<p>I trust some gifted historian of education will narrate the romantic story of the usurpation of the academic territory by the wise schoolmen of the Middle Ages, their displacement by the learned professors of the Humanities, the unwelcome intrusion of the iconoclastic devotees of the physical and natural sciences on the scene, and the entry, almost in our own generation, of the sturdy adherents of applied science, the resolute champions of technical and commercial instruction, who seem determined to fight undaunted to the finish the battle of "practical" against "liberal" education, of "useful" against "useless" knowledge. Let me plead,﻿ consequently, for freedom in the University, freedom in its inception, freedom in its administration, freedom in its expansion; surely this is the very condition of vigorous existence in an institution engaged in search after Truth. Keep your University, therefore, free from the baneful influence of dogmas; their domination is equally deleterious whatever their source, whether they be official, political, religious or academic. Indeed, the corporate repressive action of a University which fails to link by a golden thread the experience of the past with the aspirations of the future may be as potent a factor for mischief as external, non-academic interference with its activities.</p>
		<p>Will you now patiently bear with me for a while, as I rapidly sketch a very imperfect outline of an educational policy which it is my dream may be deemed worthy of trial, at no distant date, in an Indian University? The time at my disposal will not allow me even to touch the fringe of the vast area of secondary education, elementry and advanced, and I shall premise the existence of a network of well-organized schools training pupils for real University education, which is a development, an amplification, and, in many respects, a complement of school education. Such pupils, when they seek admission into the University, should be required to pass a fairly searching test, but the standard need not be ideally exacting, and undoubtedly neither capricious nor arbitrary. It is requisite at this stage of the career of the student; that his powers of expression, reasoning and observation should have been adequately﻿ developed. He should in the first place have a thorough command over his vernacular, which under normal conditions would be, up till then, the chief, if not the exclusive, medium of acquisition of knowledge; he may be reasonably expected to possess an accurate knowledge of its grammatical structure, and a fairly wide acquaintance with the best specimens of its literature; he should also have regularly cultivated the art of composition and be able to express his ideas with ease and elegance, clearness and precision. In addition to this, he should, for obvious reasons, have acquired a sound working knowledge of English language, as distinguished from English literature, and his critical faculty should have been sharpened by a comparison and contrast of the idiom, diction, method and manner of the two languages. In the second place, his power of reasoning should have been developed by a prolonged training in Arithmetic, Algebra and Geometry, experimental as well as theoretical. In the third place, his power of observation should have been developed by a practical study of select branches of the experimental sciences, including, if possible, experimental mechanics. Finally, his mental vision should have been 'widened by a study of a classical language, the geography of the world, the histories of India and England, and, if possible, also by a rudimentary knowledge of modern history. A student of average ability and industry, who has had proper training in such a course'-in a large measure through the medium of his Vernacular has, by the age of seventeen, been equipped with the elements﻿ of a liberal education and should be fully qualified to receive the benefits of a three year course for the first degree at a University.</p>
		<p>Here comes the all-important point that a student of this description, on his entrance into the University, should have the choice of a rich variety of courses. All sources of knowledge must be open to all students as they want them. Ample provision should be made for liberal, for professional and for so-called useful studies, under the guidance of first-rate teachers, the most eminent, the most earnest, the most independent in their work, for it is the eagle alone that is fit to teach the eaglets. We must realize that an institution of University rank must aim at a sphere of study and of consequent influence as wide as the whole domain of human activity; we may profitably take a lesson from the momentous decision of an Asiatic Potentate in the land of the Rising Sun, half a century ago, that knowledge shall be sought for throughout the world. In this progressive age, a University cannot with safety confine its activities to some special department, and degenerate into a school of letters, or a college of commerce, or an assemblage of laboratories and workshops. It must frankly recognize the kinship of the arts and sciences and the inherent interdependence of all study and reaserch, supplement theoretical and professional instruction by organic connection with arts and letters. I can imagine no step more unwise for an Indian University to take than to give exclusive prominence to studies peculiarly Indian. Do not misunderstand me. Indian History, Indian Antiquities, Indian Literature, Indian Philosophy, Indian Religion, Indian Mathematics, Indian Astronomy, Indian Medicine, Indian Sociology, Indian Economics, Indian Administration, Indian Art, indeed, all the monuments of Indian culture imperatively demand critical and comparative study in an Indian University. But while I appreciate the value of adequate provision in these departments and regard them as essential factors in the organization of our University, I cannot but emphasize the paramount need for fully equipped technical institutions of all grades, with courses of scientific study, theoretical and applied; for in this age- brand it as materialistic, if you please - the trained special expert is at least as indispensable to society as the most accomplished theoretical scholar.</p>
		<p>Review for a moment the characteristics of this age, though I have no desire to appraise the relative value of the different civilizations, competing in the great struggle to lead humanity. During the last half a century, the civilized world has witnessed with admiration the gigantic strides made by the intellect of man in the conquest of Nature; the developments have been as astonishing in character as they have been rapid in multiplication. The discoveries and appliances of the physical and natural sciences have facilitated the establishment of technological institutions and the promotion and enlargement of all departments of industries. To them we owe those remarkable inventions, which substitute the sinews of nature for the muscles of﻿ men and animals in the works of production; that wonderful facility of transport and distribution which makes the most precious products of each clime the source of comfort of every people; and that ever marvellous system of communication which has almost annihilated time and space and which enables each living man to sit in his chamber and converse with all other men in whispers. But these achievements of physical power, whether we regard them as means of destruction or as instruments for preservation, are but the product of the educated mind; they are under the absolute control of ideas, and whether they shall really promote or destroy civilization depends entirely upon the wise or unwise discretion of that omnipotent commander, the human mind. It is consequently a hundred-fold truer in the present than in any previous age, that ideas rule mankind, and it is not individuals, not kings, not emperors, not armies, not fleets, but ideas which overturn established systems and revolutionize social forms.</p>
		<p>Let me ask, then, what course shall we choose while the world all around us is making such gigantic strides in the path of progress, ever seeking to gain mastery over the forces of Nature. We cannot disentangle ourselves, even if we wish, from irresistible world-currents, and sit on the lovely snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas absorbed in contemplation of our glorious past. It is most emphatically true that the community, the people, the nation, the race, which like the Greek philosopher will live in its own tub, and ask the conquering powers around it to move away﻿ from its sunshine, will soon be enveloped in eternal darkness, the object of derision for its helplessness, and of contempt for its folly. We cannot afford to stand still; we must move or be overwhelmed. We cannot waste precious time and strength in defence of theories and systems which, however valuable in their days, have been swept away by the irresistable avalanche of world-wide changes. We can live neither in nor by the defeated past, and if we would live in the conquering future, we must dedicate our whole strength to shape its course and our will to discharge its duties. The most pressing question of the hour for the people of every race is, not what they have been hitherto, but what they shall determine to be hereafter, not what their fathers were, but what their children shall be. The past is of value only in so far as it illuminates the present, the present is of value only in so far as it guides us to shape the future. Let us then raise an emphatic protest against all suicidal policy of isolation and stagnation.</p>
		<p>If we thus realize the full significance of this worldwide struggle of civilized man to secure ascendency over the forces of Nature, what effective measures shall we devise to make our people worthy of an honourable place in the contest. The answer involuntarily springs to my lips, let us expand our Universities; that is the first step in upward progress; from them will flow an irresistible stream of educational facilities for the elevation of the masses. Our own sons must be taught to build and operate﻿ machinery. Fumaces and foundries, studios and workshops, must be deemed as honourable and made as abundant as the offices of the learned professions, and they must be filled with our own children, made experts in our own schools of science. Then and then alone shall we be able to make adequate provision for the full utilization of our raw materials. I feel humiliated when I realize the enormous extent to which the products of our inexhaustible natural resources are carried away to foreign shops by adventurous exploiters, the masters of educated industries elsewhere, who apply to them their skill and art, freight them back as manufactured articles, resell them for our use, and profit by the multifold increase in value. What more telling illustration could one imagine than the manufacture of sandal oil which, to the infinite eredit of your Government, is now carried on within your territory and under the supervision of the children of the soil. This, however, is not a solitary, an isolated example. When my countrymen have been adequately trained and have been afforded free and full opportunity to employ their talents, what they can accomplish in the way of utilization of our boundless natural resources of diverse descriptions, is amply illustrated by the achievements of Sir Seshadri Iyer and Sir Visvesvaraya who have played a distinguished part in the organization of gigantic works of public utility which have extorted the admiration of unfriendly crtitics. It may consequently be asserted without fear of contradiction that if we are to live, if we are to survive this age of struggle, we must keep pace with the rest of the world in scientific pursuits. We must realize that it is a fatal mistake to make ignorance the primal law of labour, for there is no labour which skill cannot elevate and improve. Let us honour and educate labour, and train our children to business and callings other than those that have hitherto monopolized the appellation of "learned professions."</p>
		<p>I have emphasized this aspect of the subject from the deep conviction that the beginning of all real improvement in your State lies in the wise and steady development of your system of education. Education is like water, to fructify it must descend. Pour out flood at the base of society and only at the base, it will saturate, stagnate and destroy. Pour it out on the summit; it will quietly and constantly percolate and descend, germinate every seed, feed every root, until over the whole area from summit to base will spring</p>
		<p class="verse">"The tender blade and then the ear </p>
		<p class="verse">And then the full corn in the ear."</p>
		<p>The struggle for national existence and progress is so keen that I earnestly entreat you to make tuition free in every department of your University. Offer education free of charge to your students. Lay no tax upon the acquisition of knowledge. Demolish the toll gates which bar the passage of light; let knowledge reach the ignorant mind, as air goes to the tired lungs and water to the parched lips. Let every father in Mysore feel and be made to rejoice in the conviction that his son has a patrimony﻿ in the University of his State. Be not alarmed at this ideal; I urge you further to arrange for the proper selection, from every corner of the State, of the promising children of orphanage and indigence, who will find here that parental kindness and smile of fortune which would secure food and raiment with education. Establish systems of scholarships and fellowships and require their recipients to distribute throughout the State the blessings they receive from the State. In the desperate strugle for existence, in the present age, it is incumbent upon you to educate each of your citizens to the utmost of his capacity. Believe me, you cannot afford to ignore the needy and the indigent; let intellectual deficiency, let moral obliquity, but let not poverty be the bar to the acquisition of knowledge that a system like this would require immense means. Forget' not that education is the one subject for which no people has ever yet paid too much. The more they pay, the richer they become, for nothing is so costly as ignorance, nothing is so cheap as knowledge. Explore the history of civilization, ancient and modern; you will find that the people who provided the greatest educational opportunities were always the most wealthy, the most powerful, the most respected, the most secure in the enjoyment of every right of person and property. This truth will be a hundred-fold more manifest in the future than it has ever been in the past, as the struggle for existence grows keener and keener. The very right arm of all future national power will rest in the education of the people. Power is leaving thrones and is taking up its abode in the intelligence of the subjects. Modern science is writing many changes in the long-established maxims of economics. Capital no longer patronizes labour, but enlightened labour takes capital by the hands and directs it where, when and how it should be invested. Educated industry has taken possession of the inexhaustible stores of Nature and of her forces, is filling the earth with her instruments of elevation and improvement, is bidding kings and rulers, empires and republics obey. The wealth, power, security and success of existing nations are accurately measured by the standards and extents of their educational systems, and those nations possess the highest standards and the most efficient and widely diffused systems of education which have taken the greatest pride in the endowment and advancement of their Universities. Bold, indeed, must be the man, who will venture to characterize these nations as wasteful, unwise or oppressive upon their people, because they liberally maintain their seats of learning.</p>
		<p>I do not propose on the present occasion to detain you with the examination of another highly controversial question, the burning question indeed of the age, namely, whether University training so develops the character as really to befit men for their work in the momentous conflict of life. It is sufficient to state that in my judgement it is impossible to emphasize too strongly the elementary truth that the formation of character is of infinitely higher consequence than the absorption of knowledge. Though the circumstances of the time have compelled me to devote﻿ the main portion of my address to what may be called the intellectual and material side of our activities, I do not under-rate the supreme value of the spiritual element. But I feel convinced that in an Indian University, addressing an Indian audience, it is superfluous for me to impress upon my young friends the paramount importance of the lesson that whether we turn our eyes to the unfathomed depths of the sea or the boundless regions of space, beyond the things which are unseen and eternal. First graduates of the University of Mysore, take to heart this fundamental truth, and never forget that you shall be responsible for the future of your State. That future will be anything you command; herein lies your grave responsibility. You have promised to your University, symbolised in your Chancellor, that to the utmost of your opportunity and ability, you will support and promote the cause of morality and sound learning, and that you will, as far as in you lies, uphold and advance social order and the well-being of your fellowmen. These are not idle forms, but words of deep import and great solemnity, deliberately utered by you as men of honour. Realize the full significance of the obligation under which you have placed yourselves, towards your University, your State and your fellow-subjects. Remember that it is not enough to be a good man and to achieve success in life. There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world; it is to stoop down and lift mankind higher. There is a nobler character than that which is merely incorruptible; it is the character﻿ which acts as an antidote and is preventive of corruption. Fearlessly speak the words which bear witness to righteouness, truth and purity. Patiently do the deeds which strengthen · virtue and kindle hope in your fellowmen. Generously lend a hand to those who are endeavouring to climb upward. Faithfully give your support and your personal help to all efforts to elevate, and purify the social life of the world. That is the way to make your life savoury and powerful. The men that have been happiest, the men that are best remembered are the men that have worked for the redemption of society'. Good men are not like trees, planted by rivers of waters, flourishing in their own pride and for their own sake, but they are like eucalyptuses, reared in the marshes, diffusing a healthful tonicinfluence and countervailing the poisonous miasma. They are like the tree of Paradise whose leaves are for the healing of nations. Be not content, therefore, merely to avoid evil and the forces of corruption. Society requires, not passive resisters but active helpers. It lies in you to illustrate the inefficacy of an education which produces learned shriks and refined skulkers. It lies in you to illuminate the perfection of an unselfish culture with the light of devotion to humanity. It is for you to prove that you are able to use all that you have learnt for the end for which it was intended, to enable you to lead the life of active benefactors of your community. Choose then as the motto of your life the noble sentiments of a poet beautifully expressed :﻿</p>
		<p class="verse">" I live for those who love me,</p>
		<p class="verse">For those who know me true,<br /> For the heaven that bends above me,</p>
		<p class="verse">And the good that I can do,<br /> For the wrongs that need resistance</p>
		<p class="verse">For the cause that lacks assistance<br /> For the future in the distance</p>
		<p class="verse">And the good that I can do."</p>
		<p>If the nobility of your souls rises to this height, I feel no doubt as to your future. From every corner of this State, there comes this day an earnest anxious voice to you enquiring, will you rise higher or fall yet lower, will you live or will you die, will you command or will you serve. Gathering in my own the voices of you all and with hearts resolved and purposes fixed, I send back the gladsome response, you shall rise, you shall live, you shall command.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the<br /> University of Mysore on 10th October 1919 <br />by Rajamantrapravina H.V. Nanjundayya,<br /> Esq., C.I.E., M.A., M.L., Vice-Chancellor.</h1>
		<p>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS</p>
		<p>To permit me to make a brief statement about the condition of the University and the results of its work during the past year.</p>
		<p>Seven hundred and sixty candidates presented themselves for the Entrance Examination and 215 or about 28 per cent were successful. The proportion of passes was somewhat less than in the previous year, a reduction mainly attributable to the general backwardness in English and in one of the Science subjects. It is to be hoped that improvements in the staff and the equipment of the Collegiate High Schools together with a rise in the qualifications of the pupils will bring about the change that is desirable in this respect.</p>
		<p>In the B.A. Examination which is held in two parts, 109 were examined for both the, parts and 64 passed in both the parts. Twenty-one students appeared for one part only and fourteen passed. On the whole, seventyeight candidates qualified themselves to receive the degree, one being placed in the first class. Fifteen students appeared for the B.Sc. Degree Examination which was held for the first time this year and twelve passed it, two of them in the first class.</p>
		<p>These results show that the comparative strictness of our Entrance test prevents a large influx of the unfit and keeps down the number of failures in the University Course.</p>
		<p>The number of students in the University increased from 619 to 734, by 95 in the Maharaja's College and 38 in the Engineering College, while in the Central College there was a decrease of 20 pupils. This decrease need not, however, cause any uneasiness, as it is due to the Engineering College drawing away a number of those who would otherwise have taken up the Science subjects. In the Maharaja's College, 76 students were studying for the degree of Bachelor of Commerce.</p>
		<p>The Entrance and the B.A. Classes of the Maharani's College for women have been separated from the lower department and transferred to the management of the University, the institution thus becoming a constituent College in the full sense, from the beginning of the present year. The number of students in the B.A. Classes increased from five to eight, and there was one woman student in the Maharaja's College.</p>
		<p>The Intermediate Examination in Engineering was held for the first time this year. Forty candidates were examined and thirty-four passed, four of them being placed in the first class.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Seventeen students of whom two are ladies have enrolled themselves for the M.A. Degree Courses newly started in the Maharaja's College in the subjects of English, Sanskrit, Philosophy and History and Economics.</p>
		<p>The B.Sc. Course in Zoology was newly opened in the Central College and since the beginning of the current year, the third year's classes have been opened in the College of Engineering, in the two branches of Civil and Mechanical Engineering.</p>
		<p>To the University Library, 2,614 volumes were added during the year, and orders were placed for books worth about sixty thousand rupees. Notwithstanding the erection of new galleries, we are already cramped for space.</p>
		<p>Some additions were made to the staff of the Colleges. Two Professors were newly posted to the Maharaja's College, and one-a lady to the Maharani's College, and one Professor and two Assistant Professors and a Drawing Instructor to the College of Engineering. The number of Professors and other teachers in the University is 77 giving an average of one teacher to 9.5 pupils.</p>
		<p>Besides taking part in tutorial guidance of the students, some members of the professorial staff were engaged in original research and literary work, and some of them took part in the delivery of extension lectures in the two cities and in two or three other places.</p>
		<p>Under the head of Publication the <em>University Magazine</em> continued to be ably conducted by Mr. Denham, and the department has also to its credit the substantial encouragement afforded to the production of some important works in Kannada. Prizes were awarded for two original works on the History of India, one on the English Constitution, and one on Astronomy, and arrangements are being made for their early publication.</p>
		<p>Private donations to the amount of forty thousand rupees have been offered and accepted during the year, the chief of them being a sum of twenty thousand rupees from Khan Bahadur Haji Ismail Sait, nine thousand from Jahagirdar Mr. Narasinga Rao Pumayya and five thousand and five hundred from Rao Sahib Mr. M. Rama Rao. The donations, which in view of the moderate level of wealth in the country are quite fair, are a very welcome sign of the general interest aroused by the foundation of a local University, but we must for a long time to come depend mainly on the liberality of Government for support, as we cannot expect any private benefactions, as e.g., in the case of the Calcutta University on a large scale.</p>
		<p>The budget of expenditure which, in 1915-16 when the University was started, was but three and a half lakhs, is nine and three-fourths lakhs for the current year, of which about seven lakhs represent permament recurring expenditure. Great as is the increase, proving the solicitude of Your Highness' Government of the rapid improvement of the University, there are urgent needs to be provided for within the next few years which require and deserve the exercise of Your Highness' generosity in even larger measure.</p>
		<p>We have not yet completed the equipment required for all the departments that we have inaugurated. In the Science Department, the M.Sc. Course which could not be opened this year for want of adequate facilities, has to be organized and begun from the beginning of 192021. For the same reason the Electrical branch of the Special Courses for students who pass the Intermediate Examination in Engineering had to be put off. In view of the importance of this course and the demand for it, it is necessary that it should also be opened as early as possible.</p>
		<p>Turning to new subjects, the University Course for the subject of Teaching for which already a small provision has been made in the budget, is under the consideration of the Senate, and may have to be provided next year. The opening of a Medical College has been urged by the Senate more than once, and the final decision now rests with Your Highness' Government, and depends on the view which they will take of the urgency of the demand for this grade of instruction compared with the existing facilities for the students and the expenditure that has to be incurred on it. A Scheme for a Law Degree being instituted was passed by the Senate and submitted to Government, but was ordered to lie over. A reconsideration of the last order has been suggested.</p>
		<p>Your Highness has approved of the preliminary proposals made for the establishment of an Agricultural College, and the matter of devising a detailed scheme is under the consideration of the Council and the Senate. This, and the removal of the College of Engineering to Mysore, will demand a large outlay in the near future. The extension of the Students' Hostel in Bangalore is another urgent matter; and such is also the erection of a suitable hall for holding examinations and such large meetings as the Convocation of the University in this city. And though not a direct concern of the University, the fuller equipment of the Collegiate High Schools and especially provision for relieving the Central College of the duty (temporarily undertaken) of finding room and means for the teaching of Science to the Bangalore High School classes are matters seriously affecting the interests of the University students.</p>
		<p>Not only in India but throughout the world, there is great ferment and widely felt aspiration towards reform and reconstruction in educational methods and matters. The monumental Report of the Calcutta University Commission which has been recommended by His Excellency the Viceroy as deserving the study and attention of a larger circle than the particular University for whose benefit it was primarily intended, shows that in the important features in which we have made a new departure, we have proceeded, on the whole, in the right direction.</p>
		<p>We have been thought by some critics to be too ambitious in our schemes, and taken by others to be merely smaller editions of existing Universities, reproducing all their defects, and containing no element of Indian State. Of late indeed a great deal of vague and indefinite longing has come to be associated with the term national education. While we should scrupulously guard all the invaluable stores of knowledge we have inherited from the past, and take care that we do not become mere feeble imitations of foreign models, we should not lose sight of the fact that there are whole departments of knowledge and learning which either did not exist or were very backward in our own country, and that it is impossible to preserve our position, not to speak of advancing to higher rank, among the nations of the world, unless we assimilate much of what Western savants and scientists have peculiarly made their own. There is a vast field for research and for co-ordination with present ideas and needs in our national literature and monuments of past culture. We were perhaps too much under the influence of non-Indian guides and instructors, whose natural limitations and often acquired prejudices did not allow them to do full justice to our past history or present conditions. Much has been done and is being done in other parts of India to remedy this defect and remove this reproach to our self-respect. It is our ambition also to contribute our humble share of work in this noble sphere. But we should not forget that in most things of knowledge that matter, there can be no nationalism. There is not one mode of culture and one system of knowledge for India, and a different method and system for England. Language is merely the vehicle of thouht, and learning and research do not become undesirable exotics when they are clothed in other languages than our own. We need not therefore be ashamed of pleading guilty to a charge of conservatism, when we decline to be led away by sonorous phrase and specious logic to upset our settled scheme of education, and rush into untried experiments on the future welfare and progress of our student population. While we are as anxious as others to introduce useful reforms and improvements in our University system, consistent with our needs and within our resources, who do not wish to run the risk of endangering our existing structure by digging away its foundations. And it is our earnest hope that with the zealous and disinterested labour of the able band of Professors and Teachers, with which the generosity of Your Highness' Government has staffed the University and continuous assiduity of an ever increasing number of enthusiastic students, we shall more and more deserve a worthy place in the company of the older and larger Universities of India, some of whom have already honoured us by extending their right hand of fellowship.</p>
		<p>I now beg Your Highness to open graciously the Second Convocation of the University of Mysore.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the<br /> University of Mysore on 10th October 1919<br /> by Sir Abdur Rahim, Ag. Chief Justice, High Court, Madras.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-01">*</a></sup></h1>
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESSES, MR. VICE-CHANCELLOR, FELLOWS OF THE MYSORE UNIVERSITY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>When His Highness, the Chancellor, honoured me with the invitation to deliver an address to-day, I accepted it readily and with pleasure. It would indeed have been difficult for me, an Indian, to fail to comply with such an invitation from a ruler so justly renowned for his enlightened and beneficent administration of one of the most important self-governing States of India. It is a real pleasure to me to have the opportunity of saying something on this occasion as, ever since I first visited Bangalore in 1909, the conviction has grown upon me that the State of Mysore is one of the best fitted in India to be a great centre of learning, research and social service.</p>
		<p>Its agreeable climate makes unflagging devotion to intellectual pursuits possible, while its mines and minerals, its forests and water power afford opportunities to the scientist hardly to be rivalled elsewhere in the country. Its picturesque natural scenery and its storied past, decipherable in monuments and inscriptions and in the ruins of ancient cities and powerful kingdoms, furnish entrancing themes not only for the inspiration of the poet and the romancist but also for the student of History and Archeology. Moreover this State has fortunately inherited traditions and conventions ordinarily associated with constitutional forms of Government, so that the atmosphere of harmony, security and freedom so essential to the growth of scholarship is largely available here, and is moreover to a large extent undisturbed by political struggles which are apt to absorb elsewhere the thought and energy of the most intellectual sons of the country.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Mysore University and its Future</strong></p>
		<p>If I were asked to forecast the future of the Mysore University, I should unhesitaingly say that its development will be mainly along the lines of scientific and technical work. That is doubtless the modern tendency of all Universities, and it is natural and meet that this tendency should be emphasized in one born in the second decade of the twentieth century. There are besides special and cogent reasons why the Mysore University will specialize in the pursuit of science and in technological training. I assume that the Mysore Government is going to pursue steadily the aim it has set before itself of developing the economic resources of the State as one of its most vital functions. That time is long past when the duty of the Government of a country was supposed to consist mainly in keeping peace and order, an idea which was born of the times when the people were deemed to exist for the Government and not the Government for the people and when Government was regarded as an outside force and not an organization of the will and resources of the people for the advancement of their welfare. The advocates of masterly inactivity as the ideal of Government have no longer any hearing. Curiously enough, this idea which is regarded as the latest tendency of socialism has been embedded in the oriental conception of Government from time immemorial. The rulers of the East have been always looked up to as the guardians and custodians of the interest of the people in every aspect of social life. It may be, that was because in the olden days the only powerful and stable organisation was the Government. But whatever the explanation the fact remains. Akbar who was perhaps the wisest ruler history has known, thought it to be within the scope of his royal functions to invent a common language for the people and even to found a new religion which would serve the common needs of the country - the two greatest factors in the making of a nation.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Development of Natural Resources</strong></p>
		<p>The Mysore Government, by healthy instinct and not as a result of any socialistic propaganda, has rightly taken upon itself the development and organization of the natural and industrial resources of the State. This will not only enrich the people and place more funds at the disposal of the Government but every workshop and factory, every engineering work and mining establishment and every preserved forest will become so many training 'grounds for the student of the sciences and of technology. They will help to accelerate the progress of scientific knowledge and research at a pace which laboratories and libraries alone could not do. The very atmosphere of a great industrial State will serve to stimulate the practical and inventive faculties of the people. It is then that libraries and laboratories and institutions like the Indian Institute of Science so munificently supported by this Government as an educational asset of great possibilities, will yield rich and abudant harvests. We have often heard complaints during the last 15 years how Indian students in search of technical training met with insuperable difficulties in finding admission in workshops and factories in India or in England. Many of them went to America, Japan and elsewhere and such among them as succeeded in acquiring practical training and experience found on their return that there were no houses of business which would give them employment. I shall however be greatly disappointed if the students of the Mysore University will not find their way considerably smoothed for them in this respect.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Importance of Literary Side</strong></p>
		<p>I have dwelt on what will perhaps be the more pronounced aspect of University work in Mysore but I must not be understood to minimise in the least degree the importance of what is called the literary or humane side of education. While the inculcation of useful knowledge and the training of intellect must always be kept in view at every distinct stage of the educational course, the building up of a strong character, the cultivation of the finer Sympathies and imagination and of noble aspirations must be regarded as an essential function of every sound system of liberal education.</p>
		<p>It is to the great credit of this Government that it has so fully recognized the supreme importance of education, due in a large measure to His Highness the Maharaja's personal zeal in the cause. The reason why education is now universally recognized as a sacred and most important duty of a Government is obvious. It is the most comprehensive and effective means of uplifting the people to their highest destiny. Education, in fact, is co-extensive in significance with civilization; there can be no civilization without education and an educated community is necessarily civilized. In the conception of modern educationists there is hardly any limit to be laid down to the scope of education. It consists in impressing into service all noble and useful thoughts, ideas and suggestions of the best men of all ages and climes, in developing to the fullest degree the mental and physical, emotional and spiritual faculties of men.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Effect of War on Education</strong></p>
		<p>It is my firm belief that the time is fast approaching when education will receive far greater attention in India than hitherto, and that partly because of the lessons of the great war which has just ended but from the shock of which the world cannot be said to have yet recovered. This war, as every one realizes, has been the greatest evil from which mankind has suffered in all parts of the Globe, comparable only to the traditional Deluge. But the worst calamities have often useful lessons to teach us. Let us fervently hope that the greatest lesson of this war will ultimately be to induce the powerful nations of the earth to devise effective means for preventing wars in the future. I confess, however, that, at present, the prospect is not at all cheering in this respect. It almost seems that so long as there are weak and helpless peoples so long the stronger nations will fight among themselves for mastery and dominion over them. I will tell you a small anecdote. The day after the war was declared by England with Germany and before the declaration of war with Austria I happened to meet an Austrian professor in London. In the course of conversation I casually asked him if Germany had an eye on poor India as well. His significant answer was that Germany would no doubt regard it as a great thing to have three hundred millions of men under her power and control. I need hardly say that the answer opened my eyes.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>War and Organized Effort</strong></p>
		<p>What, however, I would most earnestly ask my countrymen to realize is the remarkable revelation the war has made of the unlimited possibilities of organized combined effort. Millions of men, as you know, drawn from all countries of the world, Europe, the Russias, America, India, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, Africa, Arabia were formed into huge armies which incessantly fought for four years, on land, on sea, in air and under water through winter and summer, in snow, hail, blizzard and rain, in burning tropical deserts and ice-bound northern seas, in swamps and marshes full of pestilence. The myriads of soldiers and sailors were led by hundreds of thousands of trained officers supplied by Universities, Colleges, Schools, learned professions, parliaments and mercantile offices and were drawn from all grades of society. Millions more were engaged night and day in manufacturing the machines of war, cruisers, dreadnoughts, submarines, destroyers and vessels of all kinds, aeroplanes, airships, guns, bombs, shells, motors, railways, bridges, ambulances, in the production, manufacture and distribution of food and clothing and numerous other articles and provisions of necessity. For a long time whole populations were put on rations. Tens of thousands of men and women were engaged in surgical, medical, sanitary and nursing services. The best intellects and the best energies of Europe, statesmen, diplomats, scientists, orators and writers, all the great propaganda and news agencies were unceasingly devoted to this one aim, pursuit of the war. One nation alone spent eight millions sterling a day during the war and is still spending about five millions a day in winding up the war. One's</p>
		<p>imagination staggers in trying to grasp the full magnitude of the war organizations and who would not wish that all these colossal efforts, talents and power were devoted to beneficial, humane and productive work instead of being engaged in the task of mutual destruction. The whole of mankind including the three hundred submerged millions of India would then have been raised as if by a magician's wand to a higher plane of life and strength. The resources of this earth would have been so vastly enhanced that there would have been no more need for wars for "a place in the sun."
		</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Need for Organizing India</strong></p>
		<p>The immediate future does not seem to be at all encouraging at the present moment. The men who are in the centre of movements have been publicly saying that the position to-day is perhaps as perilous as during the war. This was perhaps inevitable, after such violent, widespread and prolonged dislocation of established conditions in all affairs of life. Signs are evident that efforts will be made to develop and organize even on a larger scale than hitherto all human and material resources, at the command of each ruling nation. Great Britain naturally looks more and more to India's docile but hitherto undisciplined millions as a chief source of its strength. It will be as much in her interest as of India's that this vast human mass, now so weak, inert and helpless, should be energized and made efficient. What revolutions, ideas like Bolshevism are likely to create in Europe, no one can tell. But India which is the heart of the East will, I am sure, if timely attention is paid to the well-being of the masses, remain impervious to such influences and it will not be a matter of surprise if talent, art and culture, perhaps even the emblems of honour and chivalry ultimately found a more congenial home in this country than elsewhere.</p>
		<p>But without organisation India will not be able to withstand the forces that have come and are coming into being, and one supreme aim of our educational systems should be to teach and train people to organize themselves and to act in co-operation. An unorganized people is a mere rabble, a helpless unsentient mass and can never be a power for good. Their natural and inevitable lot is to be poor-spirited, inefficient slaves whether of foreigners or of the aristocrats, of wealth or intellect or of caste or preiestcraft or of all combined. A people that have no corporate mind or will need never aspire for status. If a system of education be not calculated to improve the people's capacity for organization and co-operation that system must be vitally defective and there should be no hesitation in discarding it.</p>
		<p>India has not been wanting in men of great intellect and character and it must also be recognized that the general population of India are not deficient in intelligence and are noted for their industry, thrift, sobriety and docility. But one fatal defect of character from which the people</p>
		<p>have suffered and which has been the chief source of the country's weakness and misery is the want of power of organization and of the faculty of co-operation. No one can demur to this statement: in fact I may be charged with repeating a mere truism. But there is a prevalent tendency among many leading and educated countrymen of mine to gloss over the truth, no doubt with a purpose. They do not however deceive any one but themselves and their own people; the consequence is that a vital national work of the most comprehensive significance is relegated to the background with the result that the very goal which we are so anxious to reach remains as far off as ever. Until a reasonable harmony of aim and ideal is established, nothing nationally great can possibly be achieved.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Some Notable Examples of Organized Work</strong></p>
		<p>The difficulty does not lie with the people who in fact are most easily amenable to discipline and organization. But there are few among us who make serious endeavours to organize the people for useful social service on any large scale. The Servants of India Society, a bequest of Gokhale of beloved memory, is one of the very few such indigenous efforts which have shown any stability. On the other hand, look at the numerous Christian Missionary societies; what great educational work they have been doing in India! Now, I wish to make a suggestion. Is it not possible for the State Educational Department to call to its help the voluntary missionary effort of educated men with leisure at their disposal, in spreading education by lecturing, teaching and organizing classes and schools? In other departments, such as legislation, administration of justice and municipal administration, unpaid service of citizens are being more and more gradually utilized even in India, in addition to the work entrusted to the paid official staff.</p>
		<p>Now, either considerably more resources must be placed at the command of the State or the State must avail itself of many more voluntary agencies before it can adequately discharge its functions according to modern requirements. I think. a growth in the latter direction would be more fruitful and I see no reason why this should not be achieved in an ever-increasing measure, provided the voluntary agencies are regarded as an integral and respected service of the State.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Organizing Students for Corporate Life</strong></p>
		<p>It should be a distinct and direct aim of the educational institutions to train students in the art and methods of organization and co-operation. One 'means of doing this is by paying especial attention to the promotion of corporate life and activities in schools and colleges and the University. I am also sure that the educational experts of the State will be able to devise courses of direct instruction, in this subject. I may observe that we could do with a great deal less of smartness but we want much greater capacity in the educated people for leadership and for acting in combination.</p>
		<p>I have often felt that the full significance of liberal education is not always well grasped in this country. Nothing indeed can be more pathetic than to meet men who have received University education, unable to rise above their cramped surroundings who are afraid to think and act for themselves, whose minds are enchained to the unrecallable past, men wih no adequate perception of the great forces which are shaping the destiny of the world and with no desire to adjust themselves to the changed times. To them, indeed, any change would seem to be anathema, they think that their ancestors have said the final word on every conceivable subject and that we must recognize in all humility our infinite inferiority to those that lived in half-forgotten times. The best thing we can do, according to them, is to stick to what has been, lest we should be washed away to some strange unknown shore.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>India, Past and Present</strong></p>
		<p>They are like men living engulfed in the ruins of an ancient beautiful city, fascinated to the spot by the remnants of the great walls and pillars and arches covered with lichen and moss, the place overgrown with rank weeds and strewn with stagnant pools and poisonous marshes; a few roofs still intact and a few treasures peeping out of the vast debris - the inhabitants content with such meagre sustenance as can be wrung from stray clearings, while beyond lie stretched before them vast and rich continents stored with all that gives life and strength, waiting for the advent of enterprise and labour. To such men, I would say, take the treasures that are still left and carry them to the wide open health-giving virgin country and build and plant anew. But it would seem that the call of the dead is to them irresistible and they have no ear for the cries of the future generations.</p>
		<p>I am the last person to depreciate that sentiment of love and reverence for the past which is implanted in every healthy nature and it is but natural that we should resent with all our might, any disparagement of our country and of our ancestors as an insult to the most sacred part of our own beings. I may observe in this connection that Sir John Woodroffe rightly earned the gratitude of the people by his recent vigorous refutation of the many unjust aspersions made on India and the Indians by a foreign critic.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Need for Emancipation from Old Customs</strong></p>
		<p>But it is a poor homage to one's forefathers to allow those conceptions and usages of society, which however justifiable in ancient days are in the present circumstances fraught with mischief to the common weal, to lie as a permanent barrier athwart the path of progress. No doubt emancipation from old traditions and customs though obviously harmful cannot be achieved all at one so long as the surroundings are unprepared for such social changes. But it is the sacred duty of men educated in a modern University to undertake the essential task of social reformation. One, however, looks in vain in India of the present day for any sign of a truly liberal movement. Where do we find here any body of thinkers, writers and preachers like those of Europe who by their bold, free and earnest writings and speeches brought about those great reform movements in all departments of social life which have so considerably freed modern Europe from the trammels of blind tradition. And as it is well known it was mostly in the Universities that these momentous movements found their earliest and most eloquent exponents.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Some Recent Reform Movements</strong></p>
		<p>In India, on the other hand, there has been practically only one such movement of any importance among the Hindus, the one connected with the names of Ram Mohan Roy and Iswar Chandra Vidya Sagar; and among the Mahomedans the only movement of the kind was the one led by Syed Ahmed. The first which was identified with Brahmo Samaj seems to have received a setback, while all that is left of Syed Ahmed's efforts at social regeneration is the Aligarh College. It looks as if the present-day educated leaders of society are themselves averse to any radical or important changes except in matters political. The attitude of some of them is one of utter pessimism as if the task was too much for them. I would take them at their own estimation and pass them by.</p>
		<p>Others will tell you that they fully recognize the importance of the subject but that they are otherwise preoccupied. It is not necessary, of course, that the same men should devote themselves to every class of communal work - in fact the work of social reformation is one of such great magnitude and difficulty in this country that it requires the undivided attention of the most gifted and earnest among the sons of the country. These problems are too serious to be solved by casual attention paid by. men whose time is otherwise occupied though even small amateurish efforts may not be without some value in attracting people's attention to the problem, so long as no one imagines that this is all that is needed.</p>
		<p>I am, however, afraid that if we probe the matter more carefully, we shall find that the most serious obstacle in the way of reforms is a certain attitude of complacency and satisfaction with the existing order of things as we have inherited it from the past. This attitude now and then finds expression in various forms and sometimes it is quite militant and violent.</p>
		<p>Men of this temperament will tell you that our ancestors were great men, greater than the best men of the present day and therefore whatever they practised or sanctioned is good enough and cannot be improved upon. The fallacy of such an argument is apparent and I will demonstrate it by an illustration or two. For instance, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth which by some is called the Golden Age of English History flourished England's greatest geniuses, Shakespeare and Bacon, also Raleigh, Drake and other men who showed the way of that commercial and colonial enterprise which led to the foundation of the British Empire. But I doubt if there are any sane Englishmen who would like on that account to take to sedan chairs and stage coaches in substitution for motor cars, railways and aeroplanes or to the Elizabethan ideal of social life in which the 'gentleman' devoted to ballad and sonnetmaking, to duels and cock-fighting, was the only person worthy of consideration. Again there has been no greater hero in England than Nelson and few more decisive battles than that of Trafalgar. But do you think any Englishman would have considered it a sane proposition in 1914 that Britain should fight Germany with sailing boats built on the model of Nelson's "Victory"? Yet there are people who talk as if India is going to career through the twentieth and succeeding centuries with the outlook, the institutions and the equipment of two thousand years ago.</p>
		<p>Then we are often told that the genius of the East is different from the genius of the West and sneers are levelled at those who would imitate the methods and ways of the West.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Is Imitation a Vice ?</strong></p>
		<p>Now, is imitation really a vice to be condemned, assuming, of course, that it is of what is good and serviceable? Far from that, it is in fact a very valuable human faculty and that is why it is such an universal trait of human nature. Just as imitation is with the child a means of developing his nascent faculties so it is also with communities; for the whole history of civilization will show that imitation and adaptation have been powerful instruments of its growth. When I was a student in England 30 years ago I often heard Englishmen scoffing at the Japanese students that used then to go there in large numbers "See those little fellows, how they imitate us." Now they are looked up to as a powerful and civilized nation. When we are advised that Indians should adhere to their usages and institutions and shun those of the West, our philosopher friends or our critics seldom condenscend to particulars. · I should ask them, "Do you mean that we must hold on for ever to customs such as the caste or the seclusion of women, enforced widowhood or child marriage and close our minds against all ideas and thoughts coming from the West, eschew modern arts, sciences and appliances of life and go on being content with poverty, disease and all the miseries of a crippled life, that we should adhere to our individualistic or family ideals and not strive after any larger conception of social life or civic duty?" So put, I have no doubt the answer will be a repudiation of the suggestion, for these are really fundamental matters in which there is no room for difference of opinion. If all that is meant, however, is that changes should not be over-hasty and forced but that they must be adapted to the circumstances, here again, there should be no difference of opinion.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Need for Sacrifice</strong></p>
		<p>But the goal must be kept steadily in view. There should be no hesitation in taking any measures that would advance us nearer to it and we must be prepared to face inconveniences and sacrifices which are the inevitable concomitants of transition into a new order of things. Now a days, with rapid and world-wide intercommunications, social upheavals cannot be put off much longer, but if the educated men and those who belong to the leading classes of society are sincerely sympathetic and earnest in uplifting the masses and they take wise and timely measures for filling the gulfs that divide one class, sect or caste from another and if the economic and social problems are solved by a genuine brotherly sympathy and love, then India may accomplish her social evolution without such convulsions born of hatred as are now causing so much anxiety in Europe. The whole world is on the brink of a cyclic change and if our educated men are far-sighted, they will, instead of trying to dam the current with piles of mud and sticks, dig ample channels through which the energy can be utilized for making human society richer and better. They must adopt as the motto of their lives the true social maxim that this life must be made more and more worth living for all classes and conditions of men. Nay, all artificial barriers must in time be removed so that the age of that brotherhood and equality of man, which all great founders of religion dreamt of, may be brought nearer by a few degrees.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Calcutta University Report</strong></p>
		<p>A very notable event of the education calendar has been the publication of the report of the Calcutta University Commission. So far as I have been able to go through it, I have found it most interesting and instructive and I have not the least doubt that the authorities of this University and the Mysore Education Department will find in those five volumes considerable illuminating suggestions. As I am not an educationist, I will not attempt any criticism of the various proposals, but, generally speaking, I am in agreement with the main outlines of their scheme. I wish only to make some general observations which, I hope, will not be quite out of place. To start with, the Commissioners have rendered a great service to the country by pointing out in such a clear and convincing manner supported by a strong array of authorities that the whole system of Indian education has to be recast so as to keep it abreast of the ideals and requirements of the times. Its different divisions, such as elementary, secondary and University education, must be co-ordinated with each other as far as possible, but at the same time each must have a distinct purpose in view. In the present circumstances, elementary education in India would fail of its object unless the training of the pupil in the industry pursued by his parents or some other suitable art or craft, formed its integral part. And I must strongly urge that there should be a well-thought-out and comprehensive generous system of scholarships and stipends, for selecting distinctly promising boys from the elementary grade for the secondary schools. A proper and adequate system of scholarships, in my opinion, should indeed be in the forefront of the educational programme throughout. This, I am glad to find, is fully recognized by the Mysore Government.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Importance of Secondary Education</strong></p>
		<p>As for secondary education, that must be regarded as the backbone of every educational system. Its aim should be to make of those who have been through its full course cultured, resourceful and patriotic citizens of the State, useful to themselves and to society. A student who has completed his education in a secondary school should be fit to receive training for the different professions such as law, medicine, engineering and for mercantile and industrial business and the management of concerns like zamindaries. The course should be so framed as to occupy the average student till his eighteenth year. Here I may incidentally draw attention to one important question, whether there should be any minimum age at all for the grant of a certificate of completion of the secondary course or, if there is to be one, whether power of exemption should not be reserved for the benefit of boys of more than average ability. It seems to me that a hard and fast rule by which the most talented youths are kept backmay be for one or two crucial years -is mischievous and wholly indefensible. One point I wish particularly to emphasize before you-the supreme importance of which is so repeatedly recognized by the Commission, namely, the necessity for an adequate supply of efficient teachers without which no system of education, however well devised, has any chance of success. It is a most deplorable fact that the value of men into whose hands is entrusted the training of the future generation, should so often be assessed at starvation wages, in the lower grades even inferior to those of factory and mill hands and in no case sufficient to attract men of the best intellect and character in the country. The educational service should be at least as well paid as any other service and it should be assured as an honoured status. Then too much care cannot be bestowed on the selection of both the teaching and the administration staff. They must be men not only well educated and proficient in the subjects entrusted to them but men of sympathetic imagination who can at the same time enforce discipline, men who regard teaching as a noble profession or rather as a mission and who understand and are in full sympathy with the ideals and requirements of the country and with the ambitions of the students.﻿</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Medium of Instruction</strong></p>
		<p>Another most important question in connection with secondary education is whether English or the Vernacular should be the medium of teaching My opinion on the point is set out in full in the Commissioners' Report and all that I would say now is that I adhere to it as a statement of principle. The veraculars of the country are unfortunately too numerous and it is my own belief that not one of the them is yet fitted to be the medium of higher instruction. If there be any vernacular which possesses a sufficiently educative literature, my objection does not apply to it, but at the same time there must always be a school in 'every secondary educational division with English as the medium of instruction so as to allow of a choice. In deciding upon this question, every care should be taken not to sacrifice the interests of sound education for the sake merely of sentiment, however laudable. Besides I confess to you that I am one of those dreamers who look forward to the time when there will be one common language which has the best chance in this respect be not one of indigenous growth, such as English, I would be prepared to accept it, and readily sacrifice some very dear predilections of my own, in the best interests of the generations to come. I may also point out here that the languages of our religions and the classics are not any spoken vernaculars but either dead or foreign languages. For all boys to have to learn a number of languages when﻿ education can well be imparted and useful practical knowledge absorbed through the medium of one, is a woeful waste of energy and time, which must ultimately be obviated. It is often asserted that English can never form a proper medium of highest expression for an Indian. This is, however, contrary to patent facts. For instance, could highly abstruse philosophical and entrancingly beautiful poetic thoughts and emotions be more charmingly and at the same time accurately expressed than they have been by Rabindranath Tagore in the English language, though some of his writings are called translations? Thousands of educated Indians all over India use English as the easiest channel of communication and is it not also a fact that English, especially in the South, is rapidly gaining ground among sections at least of the labouring classes, such as skilled workmen and domestic servants, with advantage to themselves and their employers? In educated families now-a-days most children are in fact bi-lingual. These are facts which have to be taken into account in dealing with the question.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Primary Objects of a University</strong></p>
		<p>The University, as I understand it, should have two objects in view, imparting a high order of general education and culture and also professional training founded on the work already done in the school, and for students of more than average calibre and scholastic proclivities, the University should provide facilities for the acquisition﻿ of highest learning in every branch of knowledge and for training the student for scientific or literary research. If any University is to be a centre of learning and research in this sense, two things, are essential; it must, at any cost, secure the services of at least a few savants and scholars of high attainments and recognized status, and it must be generously equipped with ample and well-organized libraries and laboratories. The value of a good library is, I am afraid, not sufficiently realized in this country. It must be borne in mind that it is the thoughts of the great men of genius as enshrined in the books that are the real instruments of education and the ordinary living teachers can only help and guide the students in assimilating their ideas and in: absorbing those sublime and beautiful sentiments and emotions which, the best spirits of different ages and countries have expressed in immortal words. A further ideal which should be directly kept in view is that the graduates of the University should be fitted to be leaders of men, with their intellect, will and body efficiently trained for the task. With this end in view, emphasis is rightly laid on the importance of promoting a corporate University life, the tutors being in personal touch with the undergraduates as sympathetic but not too obtrusive guides.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Education of Girls</strong></p>
		<p>I am also in complete agreement with the opinion of the Commission that education of the girls should receive﻿ at least as much attention as that of the boys, and I beleive it to be strictly accurate to say that educated women would help to spread education and culture in the future generations and in the general community more rapidly and effectively than twice the number of educated men. In fact I believe that once education has captured the seclusion of the Indian ladies, no further propaganda work will be needed and the capacity of succeeding generations for all good work will be immensely improved. I do not know of another more potent cause of the degeneration of the country than the customs prevalent in India especially among the Mahomedans, by reason of which women lose all chances of development in free and natural ways.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Contributions to the University</strong></p>
		<p>I have not the least doubt that the citizens of this State are proud to have a University of their own. May I not also assume that every one will consider it to be his duty to make such contributions as he is capable of towards its advancement? The rich men of Mysore, the noblemen, the landowners, the merchants, the bankers and the prosperous lawyers and traders will, I earnestly hope, rejoice in having an object, wortheir than which there is none, on which to lavish their wealth and treasures. It would indeed be a matter of surprise and dis-appointment to all- may I say from His Highness the Maharaja down to an interested visitor- if the Mysore University is not richly and abundantly endowed by the munificence of the wealthy sons of the State.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Equal Opportunities to All</strong></p>
		<p>There is one matter of Mysore Educational policyapparently an integral part of the general policy of the State to which I wish to refer for one moment without entering upon an arena which lies outside my jurisdiction. I mean the effort that is being made to give equal chance of education to all communities and castes and not to allow the educational opportunities offered by the State to be monopolized by the most active and the forward. Where a State is asked to play the role of a guardian of the people and not that of a mere watchful policeman, it has to take as much care of the slow and the backward among its wards as of the more vigorous and pushing ones, if not more. At the same time the State would itself be a heavy loser if it failed to encourage intrinsic worth or talent simply because it happens to be more common in one community rather than in another. If I may be permitted to say so, the attitude of His Highness the Maharaja has, in this respect, been inspired by the highest wisdom and is worthy of imitation by other rulers. I also take this opportunity to express on behalf of the Mahomedans of this State-- with whose sentiments I may claim to be fairly familiar- their sense of grateful appreciation of the anxiety of His Highness and his Government to help them to win for themselves a position in which by﻿ their steadfast loyalty and devotion they can render services of value to the State.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Exhortation to Students</strong></p>
		<p>Graduates of the Mysore University, I now wish to offer you my warmest congratulations on the successful termination of your academic career which has just been crowned by the award of Degrees and Diplomas in this distinguished and brilliant assembly. May the memory of this eventful day long inspire you in discharging honourably and with credit the responsible duties in relation to the State, the society and yourselves which appertain to the position of a graduate of this University. As I have tried to indicate in all that I have said, the primary object of the State in instituting higher education is to produce a body of men who, by their trained intellect and moral character, by their knowledge and liberal ideas, will be of service to the State in helping the people along the highway of steady progress, enlightenment and prosperity. Do not mis-understand me. I do not mean for one moment to suggest that the State has educated you in order to employ you in certain paid official appointments. That, as you know, is not so; the paid agencies of the State are necessarily limited in number, but the State has an undeniable claim upon your services for the behoof of the people in many ways other than by employment in official departments. The mass of work that is to be done in﻿ this way is very large in almost all directions of communal life, some of which I have already indicated. What is expected of you is not that you should devote all your time to this work but that you should always remember that it is as much your duty to render some direct service to the society as to earn your own living. You must think and act not only for your own selves or your families but for the future generations of the people. How much time and thought should be devoted to one kind of work or to another is a matter of detailed adjustment to be determined by each individual with reference to his personal circumstances and the nature of social service which he is most fitted to undertake. All this may sound somewhat severe advice, but if you stretch your vision but a little into the future, and if all your care and concem no doubt realize that, by helping the State in its beneficial activities and by ameliorating the condition of the people around you, you will be making the lives of your own far more comfortable and happy than if you earned twice the income for the time being. Besides, to truly educated man, can there be a purer and a greater source of happiness than the service of his State and the people? Take it from me that at least before the war conditions supervened a man could live in Europe more comfortably, a more healthy and a fuller life with, say an income of Rs. 100 a month, than in India. Why, because there is in Europe far more of corporate effort and organization and therefore the strain on each individual is much less. For instance,﻿ locomotion in London with its innumerable tubes, railways, buses and tramways and taxis is far cheaper and easier than in Bangalore, Madras, Bombay or Calcutta or in any other city in India. Then there is very little scope here for large mansions or hotels where a number of people can live together in well-appointed rooms served by a common service. In fact the habits and ways of the people and the existing social arrangements are not economically suitable for a comfortable healthy standard of living for persons of small incomes. Then look at the condition of the poor and all that it signifies in appalling mortality, steady decline of vitality, the spread of famine and pestilence. Is it difficult for you to realize that the country has reached a critical stage and that you must change your outlook and your methods, get rid of as many obsolete notions as possible, and as fast as you can, set about organizing society for all the various kinds of necessary communal work, such as industrial development, education, social reformation and sanitation?</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>A Piece of Practical Advice</strong></p>
		<p>One piece of practical advice I should like to give you. Start on your life with as little personal and domesticburden on your shoulders as possible. You will then find that your earning capacity will greatly increase and you will at the same time be in a more favourable position to render valuable service to the State. Keep your breasts﻿ always filled with courage and faith, hold up your heads in whatever position you are placed. Look upon honest work of every kind as equally worthy of the greatest and the lowest and never scruple to brush aside whatever artificial obstacles you may find in the way of any work which your conscience tells you is for the good of humanity. Remember always that the highest mission in life is to serve one's fellow-beings. I wish you every good fortune in your future career.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the University of Mysore on 1st November 1920 by Sir Leslie Creery Miller, Kt., C.B.E., Vice-Chancellor</h1>
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>At this the Third Convocation since the birth of the University of Mysore I occupy a double position. I am as Vice-Chancellor expected, I understand, to tell you something about the doings of the University in the past year and I am also a member of the Senate or other person nominated by the Chancellor to deliver an address suitable to the occasion'. Combining these two capacities I combine also the two discourses and thereby hope to save for you some of your doubtless very valuable time and to reduce to some extent the strain upon your attention.</p>
		<p>I shall not attempt to emulate the moving eloquence of either of my predecessors in this position, nor can I pretend to offer you anything that is new. I shall endeavour to be severely practical, and I shall indent on my predecessors for my texts. I shall by no means expatiate free over all the range of educational ideals, projects and problems, a mighty maze of which I cannot pretend to have devised or even to possess a plan.</p>
		<p>I should have liked, had time permitted, to have made an attempt with the help of the charts supplied﻿ by my two predecessors, to measure to some extent the progress we have made in the short time that has elapsed since we put to sea. But as it is, two points and two only do I propose to emphasize: one I shall put before the people of Mysore and the other I shall, on behalf of that people, present to my young friends the new graduates of the Mysore University. But of these a little later.</p>
		<p>In the latter part of the past academical year the shadow of mourning has darkened the University. The death of the First Vice-Chancellor has deprived her of a very faithful friend, who sat by her cradle a zealous, loving nurse; and helped to guide her infant footsteps on her appointed path- a genial, kindly gentleman. In the deliberations of the Council we greatly miss his gentle guidance, and his complete knowledge of the details of all the subjects that came before us.</p>
		<p>He has bequeathed to the University two tokens of his good-will : a prize to be competed for by men and a prize to be competed for by women, tokens which amid many other things will serve to keep his memory green when all of us who knew him and who mourn his loss, shall have followed him.</p>
		<p>Another zealous friend Mr. Thomas Denham has left us but happily still lives to watch with interest and sympathy our efforts and our successes: and doubtless to lend us, if need be, a helping hand from time to time.</p>
		<p>I have not much to say about the year's events. Our students have increased in number by some 100 men and in the present year which commenced on the 1st of last July we have been faced with the problem of finding places for more candidates than we can easily accommodate. When our young men are urged to turn to the study of science and technical knowledge it is incumbent upon us to provide for those who accept the invitation: and how to do this is one of the questions which require solution early.</p>
		<p>But if young men are clamouring at our doors that is not the case with young women. For them we are still waiting. It may be that we are at fault: that we do not provide sufficiently varied, 'attractions' if I may so phrase it: that we ought to increase the number of the courses of study: that is obviously a matter mainly of expense. The problem from this point of view is to provide the necessary, attractions at the minimum cost. It is not insoluble, I dare say, but I am not attempting to propound the best solution, for one thing because it is clear to me that even with the restricted curriculum at present available to students of the Maharani's College, there ought to be in that College a far greater number of students than at present there are I do not seek to fix the blame for that, but I am sure the University cannot be held to be mainly, if at all, in fault.</p>
		<p>Our endowments are steadily if slowly increasing: in the past year some Rs. 4,500 have been added to the total, and since then two other gifts have been offered,﻿ one of Rs. 1,000 by a gentleman of Saklespur for a medal, and one of Rs. 5,000 by Mr. P. Raghavendra Rao also for medals in memory of his father, Mr. P. Krishna Rao. These await only formal acceptance and final settlement of the conditions of award. For all these contributions the University cannot be too grateful.</p>
		<p>I believe I am fully justified in saying that throughout the year the Government, the Senate and the Council have done all that seemed to them possible to help the University on the path of progress on which it has so recently started; but over all this endeavour has hung the cloud of poverty. "Postponed for lack of funds" has seemed to me, since I was asked to do the duty of Vice-Chancellor, to be the fate of all or nearly all the schemes suggested for expansion and development. Bid me not revive the infandum dolorem of those disappointed efforts of ours. Are they not written in the records of our Senate and Council meetings and the proceedings of the Government in the Departments of Education and Agriculture? There let them lie till times are more propitious. A kindly pat on the back by Sir Michael Sadler and some of his learned colleagues has assured us that our start has been good, that our constitution is framed on the approved lines, and my successor and the Council have now to consider with the help of an analysis full of suggestion made for them by Mr. Denham, the report of Sir Michael Sadler's Commission so far as it presents features, ideas, methods which may be found suitable for adoption here. It is probable, nay certain,﻿</p>
		<p>that some changes may be found desirable and naturally we shall be found to have made some miscalculations. I do not myself believe that any change which the new Vice-Chancellor and the Council will be able to suggest will render the administration less expensive, and it follows that so long as 'financial stringency' is with us we shall be hard put to it to do any of the many things which geven now seem to us desirable.</p>
		<p>The process of cutting our coat according to our cloth is simple enough and satisfactory enough if the material is plentiful; it becomes a difficult and somewhat disheartening task when the supplies of the cloth are insufficient to meet out demands: our aim is to turn out a really useful, comfortable and reasonably fashionable garment with all the newest improvements and adornments; and I do not doubt that even with the material now at our disposal we shall, given plenty of time, achieve a very creditable result, but if we are to be delayed till the period of financial stringency shall have waxed and waned and disappeared, our progress is likely to be very much slower than we or most of our well-wishers desire.</p>
		<p>On the one hand we have eager insistent voices, anxious and rightly anxious to provide for the youth of Mysore of both sexes, the opportunity of studying in thier own University all the branches of knowledge which they desire to acquire; one urging us to furnish our coat with an agricultural swallow-tail, another insisting on a medical cape, others suggesting full legal pockets or a musical﻿ and artistic collar and cuffs, and beside all these, we have still in our ears the voice of Sir Asutosh Mookerjee bidding us "Forget not that education is the one object for which no people has ever yet paid too much."</p>
		<p>On the other hand we have the Government holding in trust for the people the moneys gathered mainly from the people, bidding us be patient, handing out to us such quantity of mä сrial as they believe they can rightly spare for us, and bidding us make the best of it. "We know," they will tell us, "that education is the most important, as it is also the most importunate, of the departments over which our funds are to be distributed, and we may accept Sir Asutosh Mookerjee's statement that if the history of civilization be explored it will be found that "The people who provided the greatest educational opportunities were always the most wealthy, the most powerful, the most respected, the most secure in the enjoyment of every right of person and property.' We observe, however, that he speaks of 'peoples' not of Governments' and we should like some of those who have accepted his invitation to explore the history of civilization to inform us whether the proportion of the revenues expended on the provision of educational facilities by the Governments of those 'peoples' was greater than the proportion spent by us to-day." "We recognize," they may say, "that if ever the time comes when our weapons can be cast away or beaten into plough shares and pruning hooks that time will come through the spreading of knowledge, the University is one of the most important and effective agents which we can employ, but the time is not yet, when our policemen can be beaten into school-masters, our magistrates and judges turned into professors, our courts and our jails 'scrapped' or converted into libraries and lecture halls. For the present, you must be content to take your share of the revenues and that share shall be as great as we can make it with due regard to the requirements of our other necessary if less important services." That is reasonable enough, right enough. But the result is that the University fails to obtain the necessary subsistence. So far from being able to expand, so far from being able to inaugurate more courses of study in new branches of learning, or higher courses of study in those already taught, we find ourselves unable solely from lack of money to do all that ought to be done to provide for the courses which already are set out in our Calendar. I have already referred to one or two facts which show how we are situated. Our students have increased in number by about 100, and in July last for 40 seats in the Engineering, College there were 180 candidates- some from outside the State of Mysore and it was, I think, in the month of July last that one of my colleagues and I leaving the court at about halfpast two in the afternoon to enjoy a brief half hour of doubtless well- earned rest, were to our surprise escorted through the corridors by a numerous band of young men, obviously students. It was not the pattern of our gowns they came out for to study: it was not the silvery﻿ gleam of the maces borne before us that attracted their cupidity: they were simply a number of honest lads who had qualified themselves for admission to the University and were come to ask the Vice-Chancellor to help them to obtain seats in the Central College- where there was no room for them. What help was possible had in fact already been given by others. The Principal of the College had already made the best possible arrangements for the applicants and the Government readily sanctioned the necessary expenditure. So far so good, but these things are a warning. If we are likely to find increasing difficulty in providing for the accommodation of would-be University students what becomes of the proposition, put forward two years ago as axiomatic. "All sources of knowledge must be open to all students as they want them?" If the people of Mysore intend to accept this proposition, if they mean to make their University self-contained, if they desire that the young men and women of this country shall be independent of its 'recognition' by other Universities, for their higher and more specialized postgraduate studies, then they must recognize that there is only one key which can effectually lay open the sources of knowledge and that key is a key of gold; and they must make up their minds to help in the making of that key. For it has to be remembered that every student entering our halls is a source of expense no less than of pride to us. We cannot increase﻿ the number or the strength of our classes without increasing the staff of our teachers; it may be that a pleasant path in a shady grove may suffice as a lecture hall for the inspired exponents of philosophical systems; a platform under a pipal tree may do for the students of history; but for those who seek to study science under modern conditions there is more to be done; delicate and costly apparatus, specially designed and constructed lecture rooms and laboratories, all have to be provided in sufficient quantity, and none can be provided without a large expenditure. What then , are the people of Mysore going to do about it? I turn to the report of the address given at the Convocation of last year by my friend and some time colleague, Sir Abdur Rahim. What does he say about it? "I have not the least doubt that the citizens of this State are proud to have a University of their own. May I not also assume that every one will consider it to be his duty to make such contribution as he is capable of, towards its advancement? The rich men of Mysore......... will, I earnestly hope, rejoice in having an object, worthier than which there is none, on which to lavish their wealth and treasurers. It would be a matter of surprise and disappointment to all if the Mysore University is not richly and abundantly endowed by the munificence of the wealthy sons of the State."</p>
		<p>I am afraid our friend, if he has been watching us with the sympathy indicated in his address, must by this time be somewhat surprised and somewhat disappointed.﻿ Not that we are ungrateful for the gifts that have been made to us; far from it, but they, so far, are gifts for the provision of rewards to students, very valuable to the University, but not quite what Sir Abdur Rahim meant, I think, by endowment. It may be, I think it is, likely, that he somewhat over-estimated the number and perhaps the resources of the wealthy sons of the State. There are probably few whose wealth could enable them to make large contributions to the University: contributions such as the recent gift of £165,000 (say 16 lakhs of rupees) for a school of Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge, may make our mouths water but we do not at present expect a superabundant supply of them from individual citizens of Mysore.</p>
		<p>But if the citizens of Mysore are really proud of having a University of their own, if they really desire and really mean to establish it firmly on solid foundations with the least possible delay, can they not call in aid of their determination that spirit of co-operation of which so much is heard in these days? What one man cannot do by individual effort, many may accomplish by united endeavour.</p>
		<p>Surely it is not necessary to label each gift with the name and style and address of some individual donor. Can our citizens not sink their individuality in their corporate capacity? Is it not possible for a number of citizens representing some locality, or less desirably, some community, to combine﻿ in contributing an endowment? Can we not hope to see, let me say, a Senate House, presented by the citizens of Mysore City or of Mysore District? Why should we not have a chair of what you will, be it Biology, or Geology, or History, or Philosophy, or Sanskrit, founded and endowed by the citizens of Shimoga? A Tumkur professor of this, a Kolar professor of that, a Chitaldurg professor of the other? Let but our Cities, Districts, Taluks, Hoblis and what not, vie with one another in bringing gifts for the maintenance and expansion of the young University, which if all be true that is said, they were so eager to establish, and soon we shall feel that we stand firmly on our feet and may venture to increase the length of our stride. Our University is now as all of you know, not a Stateaided but a State-maintained institution: it is, I venture to think, too much dependent on the fluctuations of other schemes and projects from year to year. I do not for a moment doubt the good-will of the Government. I do not for a moment question its generosity, I do not hope or indeed wish to free the University entirely from Government control or to make it entirely self-supporting without aid from the State. I believe that it is now well established, and I give no heed to the critics who even now from time to time suggest that it is still a costly experiment, liable to be 'scrapped' if I may so express it, at short notice: I believe that it will grow and is growing in strength and in health, and that it will abundantly repay the State and people of Mysore the labour and the sacrifices they﻿ have made to estalish and to nourish it, but I believe that it will grow and ripen the better for a greater financial stability, greater financial scope for development, and I see in the gifts of the people the most promising and the best method of hastening the day of harvest. The method of hastening the day of harvest. The method at present most in vogue with the citizens, that of belabouring the shoulders of authority with the bludgeon of importunity, is a method which has its uses and achieves results, but it requires in my view to be supplemented, if not supplanted, by the method I have suggested, whereby the people themselves put the hand of assistance to the plough of endeavour. Thus will they manifest their real interest in their University and go far to ensure the increase in the future of the prosperity and happiness of their country.</p>
		<p>If I have wearied you with so long and so 'materialistic' a discourse, it is because I have felt that this is the best opportunity I am likely to get of emphasizing a matter of very great importance to the future of the University: and because it seems to me necessary to keep in view the materialistic side of our educational problem, for it is perhaps likely to be a little eclipsed and obscured by other more attractive aspects of it.</p>
		<p>Now, I turn to the matter which is the proper subject of the discourse suitable to the occasion which it is my duty to deliver, a word or two to you who have to-day received degrees in this hall and I ask you what are you going to do for Mysore what are you going to do to repay your country and your families for the sacrifices made for you, for the education already given to you and for the education which will, I hope, be given to many of you hereafter, in this University or elsewhere. If the question occurs to you what is the profession in which a young man with a University degree can best serve Mysore at present, I believe that if you give yourselves an honest and sincere answer, that answer will be 'the profession of a teacher'. Everywhere we hear of the need of education-a few days ago at the opening of the Assembly, I heard the representative of an association of members of what are known as the "depressed" classes deliver a short and interesting address to the Dewan. "What my people want of the Government," said he, "is education"; and there are few, if any, communities in Mysore of whom the same thing cannot be said. Well, if that is the universal want, are you going to help to supply it?</p>
		<p>The University will open next year a post-graduate course for a degree in Teaching, and the Government is even now, I beleive, considering a comprehensive memorandum on education and may soon enunciate a suitable and, I trust, a liberal policy. What that policy may be, I do not know; but I can hardly imagine any enlightened modern policy of education which does not involve the creation or extension of that "Net-work of well-organized schools" of which Sir Asutosh Mookerjee spoke two years ago, and﻿ each school of that net-work of well-organized schools requires a staff of skilled, trained and competent teachers. So, I venture to think you will not have any lack of opportunities of obtaining employment as teachers, and there is, I believe, we have agreed, no occupation which affords greater opportunities of doing great and noble work for Mysore. But you will naturally ask how far the adoption of the teaching profession is likely to yield you sufficient fruit. The work may be great, the work may be noble, it will certianly be taxing. Will my reward be as great? Will my prospects be as noble? May I expect adequate compensation for my toil?</p>
		<p>Well, for some years now it has, I think, been recognized that the occupation of a teacher is economically productive like that of the engineer and unlike those of the lawyer and the soldier, which in their essence are but necessary evils originating in the unwisdom of the human race and we have heard from all parts of the world, voices, powerful, eminent, wise, voices, insisting on the necessity of attracting to the service of education by the offer of adequate rewards, the best equipped minds and brains, not to say hearts, to be found among the young men and women of the country, if that country is to keep pace with others in prosperity and general wellbeing.</p>
		<p>I do not doubt that the Government of Mysore accept the soundness of the proposition so insistently urged, and it seems to me probable that in a few years' time the educational services of the State will present as many attractions to its members as any branch of the administration, and at least equal opportunities for rising to the highest positions and that not only in their own profession but also in the councils of the State.</p>
		<p>But if you think that this prophetic outline is possibly painted in colours somewhat overbright, then will you consider one other aspect of this matter? Do not we hear all round us the hymns of praise raised to the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice? Writers and teachers, lecturers and preachers, join without ceasing in exhorting and adjuring us to turn from our old faiths, to leave the multitude who throng the altars of the spirit of self-help, and join the small band of men and women who through the ages have paid their vows and brought their offerings to the altar of the spirit of service: the few who have been worshippers of that spirit not only with their lips but in their lives. "Trust no more," they tell us, "to the old dogma 'God helps those who help themselves'- dogma born of the agelong cruel struggle for life. "God helps those who help others" is nearer to the truth. Be not overbusy about your own needs whether material' or spiritual. Be not over-anxious about your own wealth, your own ambitions, your own comforts, your own souls: seek ye first the service of others, and all these things shall be added unto you." Surely a grand doctrine, if a hard one.</p>
		<p>In all this, of course, there is nothing new; for ages the doctrine of sacrifice has been preached by teachers of different religious and philosophical systems, preached it is true, but practised by few of the preachers and few rindeed of their hearers. The struggle for life has held the field for long. Is the time coming when it is beginning to yield? Many will tell you "Yes. The spirit of service is moving the peoples of to-day and will spread its influence surely, if slowly till the world is filled with its blessings." I hope that may be so, but the point now is this: if you are at all imbued or even slightly tinged with this spirit of service it should not surely be a very hard thing to live up to it, so to speak, to the extent which I am now suggesting. Even if by the adoption of teaching as a profession you cannot hope to attain as great wealth, as great worldly position, as great fame, as can be reached in other professions, other occupations, still you will not starve, your families will not lack food, clothing or shelter, you will not have to beg your bread; can you give up some hope of greater worldly advancement for yourselves, o bring to the service of your fellow-countrymen those alents which you have been able, with their aid, to levelop? Can you live for the good that you can do rather han for the goods that you can get? It is no small thing o bring light to them that sit in darkness. There are hany ways of doing it, no doubt, and I have suggested</p>
		<p>you but one and perhaps a very obvious one. It is t your choice. If you can see a better way take it, not, give mine, I pray you, your eamest consideration.﻿ Your University will watch your choice with sympathy and interest and whatever that choice be, I trust that, in the fulness of time it will bring to you your hearts' desire.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the University of Mysore on the 14th October 1921 by Dr. Brajendranath Seal, M.A., Ph.D., Vice-Chancellor</h1>
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESSES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>By the command of Your Highness, the task of delivering the address to this Convocation has devolved on the Vice-Chancellor of the University. It is an honour and a privilege for which I am deeply grateful, but mingled feelings of awe and humility, and a chastened sense of the solemnity of this grave academic funetion weigh down any formal or customary expression of that gratitude. For there are conventions, which are greater than conventionality, and to-day's function is such a Convention of the world of learning and leters. One, who has grown grey in a service which has been to him a religious ministration, joins with head bowed low and heart on high as at an altar of thanksgiving and praise! Sursum Corda!</p>
		<p>As Vice-Chancellor of the University it is my first and most humble duty to welcome the distinguished assembly before me to this great annual ceremonial, the Durbar of Learning, which has a ritual and symbolism, a pomp and paraphernalia of its own, consecrated by the traditions. of ages and the customs of peoples. And if I feel invisible presences in this assembly mingling with the visible, if I seem to see hovering overhead in this Hall of Convocation a cloud of witnesses, in which hoary figures from Aryavarta and Kumarika, from the Vindhyas and the Sahyadris, from Ashramas and Viharas and Sanghas, from the forest or the cloistral Universities of Ancient India, mingle with flitting shades froin mediaeval Vijayanagar, lifting white hands to bless those who are enrolled to-day as Initiates and Novices in the Temple of Learning, it is not a fond illusion of fancy, nor an unsubstantial vision conjured up by the historic imagination. It is literally a phantasm of the Past, a resurrected Image. For, indeed, it is with the historic memory of a race as it is with the organic memory of the plant: the records of the undying past are treasured in the subterranean storehouse of the groupsoul of a folk or race even as the organic responses of ancestral generations are locked up in the sea-moss (and the sea-aneinone) buried six thousand fathoms deep in the bed of the ocean. And these lapsed memories and faded records flit back to life and rekindle into luminiscence when the cycle of the revolving years brings back the season and the hour. It is thus that generation calls unto generation, and the procession of History deploys itself before us again.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Beginnings of English Education in Mysore</strong></p>
		<p>And not ancient history alone. The history of modern education in Mysore has also left 'an abiding mark on﻿ this pioneer University in an Indian State. Two years before Lord William Bentinck's resolution on Macaulay's minute set the seal on the New Learning in a land of old-world lore and mediaeval science, His Highness the Maharaja Sri Krishnaraja Wodeyar IJI introduced English in the capital city of his State as the vehicle of the new knowledge from the West, and the pioneer institution thus founded in an hour of destiny was known as the Raja's Free School. And the funds of the new education canie entirely out of His Highness'. Privy Purse including the supply of books to the adventurous band of students, the Pilgrim Fathers of Mysore voyaging to an unknown shore That Free School is a landmark in the history of Mysore.</p>
		<p>So early, and under such auspices, it was that Mysore began the race, and her zeal for State-maintained and State-aided education never flagged during the long arduous uphill climb which has brought her to the top of the mountain from which she can now contemplate, if she will, the fair vista of a Promised Land.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Education in Pre-British India</strong></p>
		<p>Even so does Mysore worthily continue the old Indian tradition. For in Hindu India, from time immemorial, the State (and the nobility) had maintained Ashramas and Viharas, or provided Chatuspathis (of the Quadrivia), for the Higher Learning, and the village communities made communal provision by grant of Vritti for the Mahajani﻿ Schools (or practical mass education). The net educational result, so late as only two or three decades before the Maharaja's Free School, had been a free and wide-spread education, primary, secondary as well as higher, in indigenous India, for a parallel to which, in the Middle Ages or earlier, we must go farther east, in fact to China, Burma and other Buddhist countries, in which village schools were conducted by monastic brotherhoods, or in which the State organized the administrative ranks on the basis of a competitive examination in the national classics, classics which, like our own Mahabharata, were at once vademecums of administration, encyclopaedias of useful knowledge, and store-houses of heroic legends.</p>
		<p>Even in that dark first decade of the 19th century, darkest India showed a fairly illumined chart of literacy, witness the census of 1813, witness also Munro's minute on indigenous education and Elphinstone's on the Dakshini grants of the Peshwas. Not less than 30 per cent of the boys were at school, and not less than 1 in 600 or thereabout (as compared with Scotland's proud score of 1 in 500 twenty-five years ago) were receiving in the tols and muktabs an advanced instruction in Grammer, Rhetoric and Belles Letters, in Logic, Law or Astronomy, in Therapeutics and Medicine, roughly corresponding to the University grade in our days. But when the New Learning from the West installed itself, the gentry and the priestly classes disdained to pay count, and the figures show with great probability that of every hundred who had devoted themselves to the Higher Learning in Pre-British India, only 16 had taken themselves to the New Learning by the end of the 19th century, i.e., till so late as two decades ago, and the residue had diminished by 36 per cent. The total number of persons engaged in advanced studies had been actually diminished by a third. It is only since the advent of the new movements of the Teaching University and of the smaller regional University in contemporary India, of which Mysore is a pioneer and scout, that our generation is beginning to push on to the point (and beyond the point) at which mediaeval India had carried us before.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The New Learning and the Old :- Loss of Literacy</strong></p>
		<p>The history of Modern Education in India began, then, in a conflict between the Old Learning and the New. It was Maculay's zeal for useful, practical and scientific knowledge that brought on Lord William Bentinck's Resolution of March 1835 which decided in favour of English education to the entire neglect, alike, of oriental learning and vernacular mass education. This violent breach of continuity had, as we have seen one undesirable result: there was a great loss of literacy in the country for several generations. For the old tols and muktabs and the old village or communal schools had been adjusted to the old socio-economic order, but under the new regime the social adjustment of educational values and educational organizations was upset, - with a resulting loss of literacy, both the higher and the lower﻿ literacy, in alarming proportions, which continued for generations, and is being only now recouped.</p>
		<p>As I have pointed out elsewhere, the blunder was natural at the outset. Not only in the educational policy, but also in land tenure and revenue administration, and even in the sphere of civil polity and law, it was the reforming zeal of the abstract doctrinaire, not of the farseeing and fore-seeing statesman, that prevailed. Sir Henry Maine, Sir Alfred Lyall, and other students of Indian Sociology have commented on the blunder of rashly destroying ancient institutions and over-turning the indigenous principles of socio-legal and administrative polity. Indeed, Sir Henry Meine brought about a healthy re-action in the sphere of civic polity and law. But there has been no Sir Henry Maine in the British educational administration to preserve and foster the inherited cultures and humanities of the people, and what is more vital still, to divert their indigenous passion for learning, the old Eastern instinct of disinterested knowledge, to the channels of modern thought and science.</p>
		<p>Thus it was that the modern Indian Universities in their ideals and organization cared litle for placing themselves en rapport with the indigenous ways and tendencies of thought, or the inherited cultures and humanities of the Indian peoples. It was the business of the Universities to engraft modern scientific thought and criticism and modern social aims and ideals on the old stock of Hindu or Islamic culture, but they chose to begin as if the Indian national record were a tabula rasa. But no Indian University﻿ can become a national institution, if it ignores the literary, the aesthetic, or the philosophical heritage of the Indian peoples, whether Hindu or Mahomedan. All this has brought about a curious predicament: the University-educated Indian lives in two different worlds in the home and on the public platform, but is really at home in neither. Accordingly, Vidya(Scientia) has not been justified of her children. Knowledge has failed to be socialized, and to bear its proper fruit in freedom and the joy of life, or in the disinterested joys of creation and self-giving out of the fulness within.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Need of Historic Continuity</strong></p>
		<p>Indeed, the transition from the mediaeval to the modern was on the whole gradual and continuous in Europe; at any rate it was a process of growth from within. In India, there has been a violent disruption, a breach of continuity in the national life and consciousness which has made geneuine thinking rare if not impossible. We think in counters and symbols, in meaningless abstractions and second-hand formulae, and are cut off from those original experiences of life and Nature which are the only springs of scientific or philosophic thought.</p>
		<p>Historic continuity, then, in the national life and consciouness cannot be broken with impunity. At the same time the nation must outgrow its old wrappages and swaddling clothes. Leaving the Ashramas of the Rishis, and the the Vihara: and Chatuspathis of the Scholiasts, the Genius﻿ of the Nation must come out into the cosmopolitan arena of modern life and interests. The problem before us is to adapt the highest Hindu (or Mahomedan) thought or spirituality to modern ideals of life and the universe, a problem which can be attempted only by minds familiar with the types and forms of culture in the East as well as the West, and able to survey from the philosophic height of Universal History, as from an Eiffel tower, the march of the huinan mind in any particular race or age.</p>
		<p>It will be now apparent that the conflict with which the regime of modern education in India opened a hundred years ago, the conflict between the Old Learning and the New, between indigenous and foreign education, between the Eastern and the Western Humanism, - was never solved or resolved, but only driven under-ground. And to-day it has broken out in a virulent epidemic form, and threatens to make an end of all education, in the name of national education</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>National Education</strong></p>
		<p>What is national education? Is it to be a return to the forest Ashramas or the monastic Viharas? Is it to be a return to the paint-bedaubed peepul tree in the village, to the dim cloisters in the rock-cut caves, cr to the chequered shade of the Ficus Religiosa by a purling stream? Is it to be a return to recitations and mantras, to the oral tradition of learning, the memorizing and the recital, the enthronement of authority and dogma?﻿</p>
		<p>This would be a futile anachronism, even if the resuscitation were possible. But the spirit of BharataVarsha is not an anachronism! That spirit transmigrates, and embodies itself anew in the generations of Man Persian or Greek, Semite or Scythian, Turk or Christian, whoever has wandered here and pitched his tent within the shadow of the snow-clad Himalayan ranges or the sempiternal roar of the Indian Ocean, has come under her mysterious spell. That soul of India has through the ages gone on creating a synthetic culture, in which Nature and Man have been comrades, all sentience has had its kinship recognized with reverence and homage, and the group or communal consciousness has been the nursery and school of the individual conscience. This Indian spirit has conceived an educational ideal and and educational organization, and has written on imperishable tablets outstanding chapters in the History of Human Education, as memorable as those of the Pedagogy of the Greeks, or of the European Renaissance. The essential stamp of the Genius of India is seen in many features of this indigenous education, in the outdoor cr open-air study, in intimate touch with Nature, in a corporate life or residence which weans the young from the home for initiation into the greater family of the academic corporation, in long and leisurely years of scholastic study, and above all, in the rule of Brahmacharyya, the rule of the student life comprising three great vows, the vow of chastity, the vow of poverty, and the vow of labour. The vow of Brahmacharyya embraced not cnly abstinence from luxury﻿ and from all impure excitements, not only temperance in nind and body and speech, but also the obligation of Rita, the truth. The vow of poverty abjured all covetousness and money-getting, so that the private purse of the student, prince or beggar that he might be, was cut down to the barest minimum. The vow of labour imposed on the Vidyarthi, the seeker of knowledge, menial duties for the Guru-griha and the student brotherhood, not omitting building and household economy and conservancy, and made honourable even begging for the maintenance of the Gurukula. The educational ideal was two-fold in character: in an individual reference it was Atma-Vidya, or Brahma Vidya, the knowledge of the Self, or the vision of the Absolute as the Self, the ultimate goal to which every soul must press forward in the cycle of births and deaths; in a communal reference it was the conservation and transmission of the tradition of culture and learning, of the arts and sciences, from generation to generation, a debt which the individual owes and must repay to the Rishis, the Fathers of the Race.</p>
		<p>One characteristic mark of the Educational organization was this:- Education was organized as an integral element in a man's social status. The social and communal systems on which the educational organization was based, ordained a practically free and coinpulsory higher education for the Brahman, Kshatriya and Vaisya classes, and wellnigh universal primary education for the village communities. This social and communal status not only socialized education it ensured that the theoretical instruction, whether elementary﻿ or higher, was supplemented by vocational training, in and through the Upavedas, and later on, through the Vidyas and Kalas (sciences and arts),-though there was a retrogression in the latter-day Chatuspathis and tols. Such is national education, the genuine Swadeshi commodity. Our Universities have much to learn to-day from this old indigenous organization. They may usefully build on the national foundation. But then the foundation must be broadened as well as deepened to answer the living needs of the complex democratic civilization of modern times.</p>
		<p>But a so-called national education, which is neither national, nor even education, and which, in the anxiety to avoid breeding exotic plants and orchids in a hot-house, would convert the fallow young mind of a whole generation into a noisome jungle of impenetrable cactus and thistle, militates against the national Dharma of India it leaves unpaid the debt to the Rishis, the Fathers of the Race. Back to Nature and her noble savage is the cry that goes up fron the land. At this cry, Father Agastya in the South raises his bowed head and begins to retrace his steps, and that great machinist, Visvakarma, throws up his implements in despair, for the arts of civilization which Visvakarma and Agastya initiated threaten to crumble away in a land which has been fitted to become a Karmabhumi, the land of works, through ages of Tapascharyya.</p>
		<p>For a naticnal education which abjures Science, machinery and foreign commerce misses the great outstanding fact in the History of Ancient Indian University organization﻿ and the connected History of India's Commerce with the world. That fact is this:- The great Indian Universities harboured the experts in machinery (Yantra-vidyas) and the Chemists and metalurgists, and the three great Indian discoveries or inventions which followed the fast dye, the indigo extract and the tempered steel- enabled India to command for more than a thousand years the markets of the East and the West, and secured te her an easy and universally recognized pre-eminence among the nations of the world as the Mistress of the Middle East, more so than the Munera Terrae, the perfumery and spices of her woods, the pearls of her seas, or the diamonds of her mines. A sane nationalism would revive the educational policy that led an Eastern country to that great achievement, a world-wide foreign commerce from the Eastern Archipelago to the shores of East Africa and South Europe, without the Imperialism of a Rome or a Spain. And if unfortunately India gave the secret of the Damascus blade to the world, an early instance of science ministering to the arts of destruction, she also gave the Buddha and the Perfect Law to a world in darkness and in chains. A sane Nationalism in a national Indian University would seek to harmonise science and machanism with Ahimsa, and hold forth. to generations yet unborn and a world in tribulation, the Indian ideal, once realized in History, of a non-imperialist world-commerce, alke in natural commodity and in spiritual Freedom. Which University will lead the way, one would muse and wonder, that which inherits the double﻿ renown of Vidya-Vijayanagar, on the upper reaches of the Cauveri, or that of the Eternal City on the Trident laved by the celestial Garga, or is it to be both, linked together, as they significantly are, by a cominon Head, one who is the patron of those giant works, those installations of modern science and mechanism, where the Cauveri falls roaring on the jagged jungly rocks of Shiva-Samudram, like Ganga descending on Shiva's own matted locks,- and who is also the inheritor of the immemorial tradition of the East, of Maitri and Peace!</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The International University</strong></p>
		<p>This leads me to a paradox:- A truly national University in India must be inter-national. For India has always been the meeting-ground of divers civilizations, God's own melting-pot for the fusion of warring races and cultures heated in the furnace of tribulation. The radicle of every Indian people to-day is a composite one, physically as well as culturally. And if this compositeness applies to the geographical distribution in racial zones, it applies with equal truth to the temporal distribution, the historic procession of the ages. For India is at once ancient, mediaeval and modern. And she is united to the Semitic East of Western Asia, as she is united to the Mongol East of Far Cathay. Universalism and synthesis have therefore been India's message throughout the ages, in the Religion of the Gita,﻿ in the Sarvadharma(Universal Religion) of the Jina, in the Sarvagama-pramanya (all-religions-true) of the tenth century, in the Bharatapartha (the All-India Road) of Kabir, in Akbar's Dream, in the Yezur-Veda of Nobili, in Raja Rammohan Ray's cosmic vision. That perpetual fount of Universalism has not dried up on this soil. A world gone mad and clanking the chains in Hymns of Hate, looks, and looks not in vain, to the East, nay to India, for a new gospel of Freedom, a gospel born of the Peace of the Spirit in the oneness of the Brahman!</p>
		<p>Even in Pouranik India, the Indian Universities studied the Yavanamata, the foreign cult and culture of the times. This was the last but one of the 32 sciences, the penultimate science. The strange spectacle of National Universities in a modern India declaring war against that world-culture, the Yavanamata, with all the violence (and strafe) of a Durbasha's soul-force, constitutes one of the great Betrayals in History, the betrayal of the Mother by her best beloved, nay, her own truest child!</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Regional University</strong></p>
		<p>From the international University to the regional, which is now my theme, is not so abrupt a turn as it might seem. Both are signs of the times, complementary expressions of the twentieth century Renaissance.</p>
		<p>The international University, as conceived in recent International Conferences, will be a twentieth century﻿ El Azhar, congregating, in some world-centre, characteristic national groups of travelling or visiting professors and students from the various Universities of the world. Like those wandering hands, the scholastici vagantes, of Mediaeval Europe, or like those visitors to our own Mediaeval Universities of Vikramasila and Odontopuri, so late as the twelfth century, from Samarcand and Sir Daria in the West to Siam and Chakradvipa in the East, this twentieth century fraternity of scholars will forge anew those golden bonds of international comaraderie which were shattered three centuries ago by the fateful advent of Nationality and still more of Nationalism in the post-Renaissance world! Mysore University will gladly take part in that fraternal world-exchange, when the call comes.</p>
		<p>The Unitary and the Synthetic University</p>
		<p>In the meantime we will be building up the regional University of Mysore. For we in India have now definitely left behind the era of the examining University which regulates College teaching but does not itself teach. Our prototype London has herself undergone two transformations, and will yet undergo a third under the recommendations of the Haldane Commission. In India the Teaching University came to birth in 1905-1906 on the heights of Simla. Its first local habitation and name was the University of Calcutta. It taught only the post-graduate courses. But its real greatness lay in this: it created a new organization for the first time on Indian soil, the organization and Indianization﻿ of Research, - a creation which has done more there than anything else to earn brotherly recognition for the synthetic vision and genius of India in the World's Commonwealth of Learning to-day.</p>
		<p>Of the Teaching University, there are many structural types, the Unitary, the Synthetic, the Federal. The Unitary type has a single centre with one or more incorporated or constituent colleges. The Synthetic type builds on a synthesis between the University and the Colleges which have a quasi-independent foundation. Where a Teaching University comes as the crown and apex of a long history of Collegiate developments as in Calcutta, the synthetic type is a necessity. In Mysore, there has been a similar history, but the colleges are all State Colleges, and the State University has been fortunately able to incorporate them all. So far it has conformed to the unitary type. But it has two centres, and therein it departs from the orthodox unitary pattern. Ours therefore is the inevitable tertium quid, neither a Unitary nor a Synthetic University proper. And until the University organizes independent Departments of its own, we tend to have a 'diversity of colleges under one central administrative control, rather than a Teaching University. The predicament of Calcutta is worse; it has centres everywhere and a circumference nowhere except in a five-mile belt in Dacca! Whether our position in Mysore is one of stable or unstable equilibrium or of no equilibrium, remains to be seen.﻿</p>
		<p>If in the matter of a unitary polycentric University we have been pioneers in India, we are likely to be pioneers in a still more important development, which has a world. wide interest and significance. By one of the accidents of our Collegiate history, this University teaches Arts and Humanities in one place, and Science in another. But she must teach that inter-connected Humanism and Naturalism, which is the badge of modern life and culture. To be modern, she must supplement Arts with Science, and Science with Humanity! With these coming developments, Mysore will assume the character of a Federation of University colleges, or practically of Universities. The experiment in federation failed at the Victoria University, because it was on an affiliating basis and was externally imposed. We here in Mysore are bound to succeed because it will be a natural development from within on a unitary basis. In India, the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, - if not Bengal, East and West -are likely to develop a Federation, after we have solved the converse problem of developing autonomy within the limits of central control.</p>
		<p>In another matter, we have been precursors: Mysore interpolated a one-year course (which she calls the Entrance class) as preparatory to the University. We may have to extend it now, but the experiment was in the direction of the Intermediate College now seen to be a vital necessity.﻿</p>
		<p>Our Extension Lectures and University Publications are yet in a ridimentary stage, but they testify to a fundamental fact; we aim at developing into a People's University, that coming event in the Hisotry of Human Education! A necessary corollary is a Mission to the people.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Desiderata</strong></p>
		<p>But we have not been equally forward in many an other direction. We have developed a post-graduate degree the M.A. in the Arts department, but none yet in Science. We have not yet differentiated between Pass Courses and Honours schools for graduation, though this is a necessary foundation for the development of Research. And in the matter of Research, that training which comes of the joint work of the professor and the post-graduate or Honours student is not in evidence. We issue no Bulletins of work done in the various departments of the University, and though one or two individual Professors in the University and the Curator of the Oriental Library have done valuable work which has met with wide recognition in the learned world and in distant Universities, we as a University have done little or nothing to organize Research. And yet Research, the Advancement of Learning, creative or constructive culture, is the very breath in the countenance of a modern University, indeed of all national organization and administration in a progressive State:' its endowment is always an object of special concern to Parliaments and Governments. For﻿ any intensive administration which is faced with problems of development, and which must aim, according to a preordered plan, at utilizing to the full all the resources and capabilities of a people and region, can ignore Research only at its own peril!</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Women's Education</strong></p>
		<p>The higher education of women has been attempted by us in the Grand style, with a Women's College and Women Professors and Senators, which might have satisfied Princess Ida herself, though there is nothing particularly epic or homicidal in it. But somehow our programme has not caught on. Man rarely succeeds in educating woman, though woman makes it her daily business to educate (and to civilize) man, and succeeds-- more or less!</p>
		<p>Now that the great war has brought a truce, a perpetual one, seemingly, between the sexes, if it has not yet united the Nations in a League, it is proper that we set our house in order. The immobile rigidity of the position in India as regards High School and College education for girls is not merely a result of India's conservatism or apathy. In organizing women's education, the abstract doctrinaires mishandled the problemn from the beginning. There have been two capital blunders. They ignored the essential fact that women of different social traditions and functional classes are more differentiated than are men, and that a compulsorily uniforme school graduation or plan﻿ for men and women, or even for women of differing traditions, would be going against the grain. They also fell into the grievous blunder of making the termini and the spans of the different grades of education the same for boys and girls, irrespective of the differences in their cycles of physical and mental growth, and in espective of the varying termini imposed by divers marriage customs and marriageable ages depending partly on those very cycles. In Mysore, for example, keeping in view the existing or emerging social stratification and girl's marriageable ages, there ought to be successive termini at the ages 12, 14, 16, 18, as we pass from the Primary to the Intermediate stage, and each terminus should open unto a proper sphere or destination in society, or lead on to the next higher stage. And for growing girls between 14 and 18, all public tests or examinations are to be shunned as suicidal for the race. In the upper forms of the High Schools there should be more and higher) imaginative and historical literature in the vernacular, for those girls who go in for Arts. Continuation classes at home, for married women and widows, should be started under the auspices of women's associations like the Mahila Seva Samaj of Bangalore. Training in home-industries and vocational education should be provided in the schools for such young widows as cannot go beyond the school-leaving stage, necessarily a large class where a considerable section of society have the custom of early and universal marriage with no remarriage for widows, and have latterly developed the practice of matching and﻿ mating two such classes of unequal incidence of mortality as girls between 9 and 12, and youths between 18 and 22. The University education of women must also be remodelled in two different directions. First, in the ordinary University Course, women may be given the option of additional courses in Literature, the Fine Arts, Hygiene or Advanced Domestic Economy and Domestic Science, in lieu of certain subjects in the regular curriculum. Secondly, and this is even more important and urgent, special facilities should be granted to women for learning the professions of Teaching and Medicine, and for being trained in child welfare, social service and social propaganda work, such as will give them proper openings in the sphere of women's work and status in the new Indian polity. It is only when women's education has been remodelled from top to bottom on these lines, and the original blunder rectified, that in the existing social conditions of Mysore we can hope to draw upon a normal and steady flow from the lower into the higher channels in place of the scanty, capricious and intermittent supply of the last quarter of a century.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>New Faculties</strong></p>
		<p>Again, as an infant University, our Faculties are yet undeveloped. Engineering and Commerce, normally the earliest and the latest to appear, have already emerged. To this Teaching may be added as having already arrived.﻿ But others are waiting in the vestibule, or perhaps in the streets. To take these in the order of their urgency, as I conceive it -- Agriculture, Forestry, Mining, Medicine and Public Health, Chemical Technology, Law and Administration, Oriental Research, have yet to make headway, from the field and the forest, the mine and the workshop, the Court or the hospital, the school or the Pathasala, entering by all portals into the University,+ for the University of to-day, like the State itself, is unfversal as life! But they cannot all come in at once. First, there is a certain natural order in the development of these studies which cannot be transgressed. Secondly, their order must also conform to the order of development in the social and the public economy of this people and this State. Thirdly, facultative studies in the University can develop only after (and out of) the Intermediate Colleges which will add certain optional courses in Applied Science and vocational training preparatory either to callings in life, or to technological studies for a license or diploma in the University.</p>
		<p>Let me take agriculture for an example. Mysore, like the rest of India, has in agriculture the one original staple industry, the fruitful mother of a hundred more, and the great nourisher and provider of her children. And Mysore must guard against the devitalizing process, the abandonment of the soil, of field and farm and homestead, which inevitably ends in rural destitution and devastation, in the overturning of the economic balance, and in the drying up of those reservoirs which feed with﻿ a plentiful supply not only the State exchequer but also the factories and workshops depending on the raw produce of the fields, the forests and the mines. Only the development of agriculture as a means of independent income or livelihood for men of narrow means and narrower acres can avert these risks of rural depopulation. No doubt, high class research work on soils, manures and pests, on cross-breeding, acclimatization and fertilization, will continue to be done by Reserch Departments, whether outside or inside the University, but that which a country with the agricultural population and capabilities of Mysore must develop with zeal and foresight is a number of agricultural (and connected) pursuits in central as well as outlying tracts, and these can be built up on a modern basis only by he co-operation of the State and the landed as well as landless cultivator, with the help of trained intelligence and co-operative credit. A considerable body of trained entrepreneurs, agents and overseers, working on Sir Horace Plunkett's plan of cooperative production and co-operative distribution, are required to solve the agricultural problems of a peasantry not less numerous than the Irish, and in this country they can be created only by the Intermediate Colleges on their vocational side, in which liberal education in the basic and applied sciences will be combined with practical training and farm work to be followed presently by one year's further training for the lower University diploma. These trained men attached to the soil and sprung from the soil will form the necessary link between the peasantry and the experts of the Research Department and of the Model and Demonstration Farms, but unfortunately this has been hitherto a missing link in the evolution of a scientific, at any rate a modern, Indian agriculture. Many things await skilled and co-operative treatment: intensive farming, the growing of cotton, sugarcane, oil-seeds and fibres, dairy farming, cattle breeding and fodder ensilage, among others; but a system of instruction in practical farming in the field classes or in secondary schools, 'will fail to evoke the capacity for that intelligent adaptation and control of the processes or factors involved, which only a scientific education ensures. And such scientific education of a foreign tradition and in a foreign vehicle cannot be imparted to the Indian before he reaches the Intermediate and the University diploma stage. In Mysore, the present Director of Agriculture has already done very valuable work as a pioneer of agricultural education on modern lines, and further developments that may be necessary will benefit by his extensive knowledge and study of Indian conditions.</p>
		<p>What applies to the Department of Agriculture and to its intimate bearing on the coming developments in the University applies with greater or less force to other departments as well, such as those of Public Works, Industries and Commerce, Mining, Forestry, the Geological and Chemical Departments, and Archaeology. Many of these departments exist for developing to their fullest the capabilities and resources of the State, and the best of capabilities is of course the capacity of the people, which must therefore be trained. The University is the central organ of that teaching. It builds the scientific foundation in correlated studies and in pure research, and it must complete the practical training given in its own departments by means of filiation to and co-ordination with the corresponding departments of the State. An intimate alliance between the State departments and the State University for training as well as research is a characteristic feature of advanced and intensive educational administration and organization to-day. Indeed such filiation and co-ordination are a sine. qua non, if the State University is to be, not an Encyclopaedic University of the Napoleonic pattern, nor a Pure Culture or Research Installation, but, a Regional University whose business it is to organize teaching and research so as to develop the material and moral capabilities of the region and the people in intimate relation to each other.</p>
		<p>But this alliance does not mean that the graduates so turned out must expect to be absorbed in the State service or administration. Some of them will certainly be so absorbed, but by far the larger number must carry on the work in new and virgin fields by individual or joint enterprise and effort. They must settle down in the country, or spread abroad, over the Indian continent, carrying far and wide the prestige of their own State and their own people as among the most potent and creative forces in the Indian Renaissance which is being born today in the throes of a mighty birth!</p>
		<p>It is only thus,- if we sow the seed broadcast on the soil,- that, one day, a great harvest may await the sickle of the reaper. But Doubt never sowed, nor Impatience ever reaped. We are on the Mount of Vision, and must possess the faith that crossed the wilderness and climbed the mountain to be. vouchsafed the sight of the Promised Land.</p>
		<p>Our University students (not discounting the Entrance Classes), roughly speaking, number 1 in 3,200 of the population, against Bengal's 1 in 1,500, and Scotland's 1 in 600 several years ago. Those who fear 'a glut may set their fears at rest. And the best comfort is the reflection that this is a Regional University, as I said in my inaugural speech at the Senate, adapts its studies to the utilization of the man-power as well as the natural resources of the region. The organization and training of efficient manhood in every department of national and social activity is the watchword of education, and the University is the chief agency in the mobilization of all the cultural resources of the nation for the paramount purposes of national expansion and progress, nay of national existence itself. A Regional University is the people's business, and it is a first charge on the national income.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>University Finance</strong></p>
		<p>One curious fact stands out on an examination of the expenditure on the University under the different﻿ heads, a fact which is apt to be missed and therefore deserves to be mentioned- it is the exceedingly low additional cost of the arrangements which have converted the previously existing Colleges into a Regional University. If it be remembered that the Central College, the Maharaja's College, the Maharani's College and the Oriental Library were all in existence before the University was born, and that the Engineering College was in existence years ago, though it was subsequently disestablished, if it be also bome in mind that with the growth of the student population and its needs the further extensions and developments of these Institutions could not have been prevented, it will be realized that the arrangements for their conversion into a University do not cost more than three-quarters of a lakh in all, out of a sum of about forty-three lakhs and a quarter spent on education, - in other words, no more than 1.7 per cent. Even if the University as such were to cease to exist, these Institutions could not cease, and the relief to the public funds, so far as the recurring expenditure is concerned, would, be no more than a rupee and twelve annas out of every hundred rupees spent on education in the State. With this sum of a rupee and twelve. annas we ensure a future of progressive efficiency and economy for the remaining 98 rupees; we give a central organ, a sort of cerebrospinal system, to the educational organization of the State; lastly, we give a Regional University which is at once the heritage and the intellectual capital of every province in India to-day, and to which a progressive and enlightened State here in the South first showed the way.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Pending Questions - The Senate Committee for Reorganization</strong></p>
		<p>Other questions still await solution and are being considered, e.g.,. the question of College fees, or in other words, the share borne by the State of the cost of educating each student of the scheme of scholarships and stipends in the University,--the proper regulation of Science teaching in the Entrance and preparatory stages and the extent of accommodation for Science students in the University, the place of the Vemacular and other languages in the curricula, schemes of Physical Culture and of medical inspection and student welfare, the introduction of a postgraduate course in Teaching, the provision of a year's practical training as a preliminary to the Bachelor's degree in Engineering, and the future course and development of the Commerce Department.</p>
		<p>But the question of questions before us is the orientation of our University to the scheme outlined in the monumental report of the Calcuta University Commission. That was in reality an All-India Commission, and the older Universities have begun to build on the ground-plan sketched by the Commissioners. Our University in conformity to the general plan must re-model and re-orientate itself, and the Senate appointed a Committee in March last to report on the﻿ question. This reorganization must be our main business in the next two years.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Statistics of Passes</strong></p>
		<p>The number of students in the colleges has risen steadily from 593 in the year the University was started to 1,048 in 1920-21, an increase of 76 per cent. The increase was, roughly speaking, 4 per cent in the first year, 19 and 14 per cent successively in the next years, and 26 per cent in the last. This shows an acceleration. The number of Entrance passes increased from 120 in 1917 to 420 in 1920, but fell to 282 in 1921 owing to a heavy percentage of failures. The proportion of passes has been very unsteady, having been in the neighbourhood of a half in 1917 and 1920, and of a third in 1918, 1919 and 1921. The number of B.A.'s has risen from 40 in 1917 to 135 in the present year, and the number of Bachelors in Science from 12 in 1919 to 28 in the present year. The number of Bachelors in Commerce has been 20 in this year as in the last. 29 students passed the Bachelorship in Engineering, but they are not entitled to the degree till they have completed a year's practical training in some approved Engineering firm or works. 15 have qualified for the Master's degree, 4 in English, 1 in Philosophy, 3 in Sanskrit and 7 in History, Economics and Political Science. 4 ladies are eligible for the Bachelor's Degree in the present year against 1 lady graduate from this State in 1917.﻿</p>
		<p>The percentage of passes for the B.A. Examination has varied far less than that for the Entrance. Discounting the last year when only a third of the candidates were successful, the proportion has been well over a half; and in the present year it has been well over three-fifths. In the Entrance, the proportion has fluctuated from a third to a half; in the B.A. from a half to three-fifths. The higher level of success in the later and higher examination shows that the Entrance serves its purpose as a sieve to some extent.</p>
		<p>It appears that the number of graduates turned out in the last two years bore a proportion of 40 per cent to the number of candidates who had sat for the Entrance Examination in the corresponding biennium three years back.</p>
		<p>We have not gone in, it appears, for the opposite system under which many are called but few are chosen; in other words, where the matriculation percentage is high and the percentage of graduation low. The question of adopting one system or the other is a matter of free choice, depending on considerations of the social economy and the effective social demand for different grades of training and efficiency.</p>
		<p>I cannot close the brief report of our work during the last year without expressing my grateful regards for my distinguished predecessor, Sir Leslie Miller, who guided the fortunes of the University during an interregnum. His administration of the affairs of the University was marked﻿ by a sound and penetrating judgement, clearness of perception, and a judicial habit of mind. These traits coupled with a dignified and imperturbable urbanity of temper have made him a most helpful and valued Colleague on the University Council. His address at the last Convocation, in sounding a note of warning as regards the financial outlook of the University, appealed to local beneficence and patriotism for the endowment of Chairs in the University, and it is to be hoped that a fitting response will be forthcoming to an appeal so frank and convincing. Several endowments were acknowledged by my predecessor last year. Three more endowments call for notice, one by Rao Bahadur M.C. Rangaiengar, one by the Bhabha Memorial Fund Committee, and the third by the now defunct Mysore Branch of the National Indian Association received through Rao Bahadur M.C. Rangaiengar. The University is deeply grateful to the donors for their valued contributions.</p>
		<p>It gives me great pleasure now to address a few words to the students assembled at this Convocation. You who have been called by your Alma Mater to receive her benedictions, to my first greeting to you is in the words of the poet "My heart is at your festival." I congratulate you on your personal triumphs and success. I congratulate you still more because you live in stirring times. It has been your lot to live through the greatest War in History, through a world-cataclysm which has changed the face of things on this globe for all time. "One hour of crowded glorious life is worth an age without a name." The great War has been even more fatal to all half-truths and makebelieves, to patched-up virtues and soft glossings, than any of the great Religions of Mankind. And young as you are, the Psychology of War and of the after-math of War, has profoundly affected the perspective of youth. The "vision splendid" in you has assumed a sober colouring from man's mortality, and your ears have heard the song of the Fates, above the roar and tumult of the world!</p>
		<p>For many of you, for most of you, questions of personal happiness and unhappiness are beside the mark to-day. With your motherland in a devastating conflagration, in the throes of a mighty convulsion which has broken up her peaceful and ordered progress, you are burning with a passion for you know not what. a passion of selfimmolation in some glorious cause. Nothing external has happened to you, but of a sudden you feel that the world has changed its face! there suddenly start up around you enveloping mists and dazzling glories, angelic choirs and dreadful silences. You, young men, are those of whom it was foretold: your young men shall dream dreams. They are those who live in Messianic times, for whom the faroff divine event comes and stands greeting at the door. That event and those times do not bring glad tidings. Most often, they are times of tribulation and of darkness, but a divine madness fills them. I read signs of that enthusiasm in your hungry eyes. I will not summon you to the bar of Reason, and arraign your Hope of visionariness and your Love of blindness. Love is apt to be blind,﻿ and Hope is always enchanted. But I call you, children of Bharatavarsha, to a larger Hope, and a diviner Love. That Hope shall make you free as the Truth alone can make you free, and that Love shall be Wisdom.</p>
		<p>But first let me speak to you of the other love, which possesses with something of a demoniac possession: the love of your country, the love of Freedom. What is your country? What is your Freedom?</p>
		<p>I will answer for you. Your country is Bharata, but Bharata is not, has never been, confined within territorial bounds. Brahma is the true country of the Spirit: that has been India's claim through the ages! And Brahmavarta, Aryavarta, Bharatavarsha, Jumbudvipa,in extending circles, the country of the Spirit has ever moved forward: it has had territorial embodiments, but no territorial limits. The visible country is but a symbol of the cosmos, the visible History is but a moment in Eternity. You cannot be true to your country if your vision should be so blurred as to barter the cosmic and the eternal for a place in or out of the British Empire, or, for that matter, for the dominion of the Earth. You belong to &#38;tradition and a race that carried with it the original home, Brahma or Brahmavarta, in its march, its migrations, its settlements. Do not sell that birthright for a mess of pottage. Claim the entire world as your own. Wherever the Atman reveals itself you have your country and countrymen; wherever the Atman is dishonoured, you are ousted and dishonoureda Correct therefore your country's true standpoint. Political,﻿ national, territorial organizations and delimitations, the historic passion and patriotism, are all very real, and must be accepted as a working arrangement, but not unto blindness and obsession, unto hate or fury, unto the self-alienation of the Spirit. India, this Greater India, which has no bounds or confines, calls to you as your patria eterna. May this Sanatana Bharata, your Eternal country, represent through you, her sons, in the Leagues and Councils of the World, the idea of this extra-territorial nationality, this extra-territorial sovereignty, which the creed of Buddha, the Enlightened and the Enlightener, first preached to the world: A Buddhist Sloka given by Aryadeva, the itinerant Buddhist preacher, to the masses exhorts the sovereigns of the world to follow the Code of Dharma without territorial limits, a Code of Laws which places the good of other States and peoples in the same category with that of their own. See that you are not betrayed into any obsession of hate which makes you unfit to be Servants of this Greater India, in whose name you must go forth to the nations of the world. It is a name which unites,- for the follower of the Prophet will recognize herein the advent of his Islam, the Peace of God, and the follower of the Son of Man the advent of the promised Kingdom of God.</p>
		<p>Unites! For it is the one great law of Personality in the individual as in the group or mass: Each can realize himself only by helping others to realize themselves. And this law implies the converse each can help others to realize themselves, only if he seeks to realize himself. Each in all, and all in each! For it is the Great Being, Universal Humanity, or as others would have it, the Great God, who is being accomplished and fulfilled in every man, woman and child, individually as well as collectively. Doing or suffering, enjoying or enjoyed, we are His hands and His feet, His eyes and His mouths. The weakness of one is the weakness of all, the strength of one is the strength of all. Victory is mine, saith the Lord; defeat is inine, saith His Consort of the Infinite Compassion!</p>
		<p>And seek not the lesser Freedom, but first the Greater Freedom which embraces all lesser privileges and franchises. Be free of the Commonwealth, not merely of the Federation of the British Empire or of the WorldFederation when it comes, but also of this your true country, the Country of the Spirit. Remember you are citizens of no mean city, not of Benares, not of Delhi, not of Rome, those eternal cities of the East or the West that come on the tidal waves of History and are borne away by that tide, but of the Eternal City that sits enthroned in the Brahman above the uproar and the tumult of Man in his generations!﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the University of Mysore on 4th October by Munir-ul-Talim H.J. Bhabha, M.A.</h1>
		<p>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS, MEMBERS OF THE SENATE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>I esteem it a great honour and privilege to be invited from my seclusion to deliver an address before this Convocation. The higher the honour the greater is my diffidence to appear before you after the eminent educationists who have given excellent addresses on previous occasions. I fear I was somewhat hasty when I accepted the invitation from a sense of duty to obey His Highness the Chancellor's wish which was to me a command rather than from any exaggerated feeling of self-esteem. I have put together a few thoughts that have struck me from a distance, for the expression of which I beseech your kind indulgence.
		</p>
		<p>When shortly after my retirement from the Educational Department, over which I had the honour to preside for a period of twenty years, it was decided to estalish the University of Mysore, I heard the news with feelings of great gratification. That the department which had been built up with strenuous exertion for a long series of years was to be crowned by a University naturally filled my﻿ heart with joy and pride. The wisdom of having a University of our own which had long been looked forward to cannot be doubted. The Colleges which had been affiliated to a distant Univesity naturally would benefit the most by the establishment of a local University of which they would be integral parts, and in the management of which they > would have a leading part. The curricula and schemes of examinations instead of being super-imposed by a distant and sometimes unsympathetic body would be arranged to their own satisfaction by the local Professors on well-thought outlines. It is a great thing for a people to have a Teaching University of their own in direct sympathy with their wants and aspirations, so that they may have the kind of education they esteem most advantageous to their interests. No system of education can flourish so well as that which satisfies the needs and wishes of the people. Such a Teaching University does away with the disadvantages of external examinations and brings students and professors into intimate connection, so that cramming of the worst kind is effectively discouraged and real progress and scholarly knowledge are encouraged, while at the same time physical education and the training of character are attended to with great care. The University of Mysore, though it cannot strike out any great departures from the beaten track of older Universities, will be free to encourage the study of Kannada, Sanskrit and Persian in a satisfactory way, to foster the growth and publication of a modern Kannada literature without﻿ which the education of a whole people cannot proceed, to promote the study of such new objects and provide such practical training as may satisfy the aspirations of the people and suit their economic and social needs, to form sehemes of its economic and social needs, to form schemes of its own of female education and oriental learning, and to arouse patriotic love within the hearts of the people for a system of education which is under their own control. There is further no agency so powerful as a local University for extra-mural instruction, for not merely organizing what are called Extension Lectures but regular schemes for adult education for giving instruction up to the level of University standards to people whom circumstances have not permitted to acquire higher education but who have the desire and ability to profit by it. These are no small advantages, and that they are now available to the people of this State presages a bright educational future for them.</p>
		<p>The Mysore State has always been distinguished for its earnestness and liberality in promoting education. No Native State or Provincial Government in India has been able to spare such a large proportion of its revenues for education as the Mysore State. This is hardly a place for giving comparative statistics, but your Educational Department can easily prove that the proportion of total revenues spent on Education in Mysore is the highest of any province in India, though it may be much lower than in the advanced countries of Europe and America, and in Japan. In an advanced State like Mysore a University﻿ was bound to come, and though some publicists may be tempted to be critical and look askance at the commencement, when in a short time it has proved its great usefulness, it will disarm all criticism and ungenerous comments.</p>
		<p>One of the principal advantages of having a Teaching University of our own is to have a full-time Vice-Chancellor who watches over the instruction and discipline of the students, their physical welfare, their corporate life and intimate connection with their Professors. I may be excused however if I refer, for a moment, to a possible danger, though it should be very unlikely, of the sense of responsibility of the Heads and Professors of Colleges getting weakened for the maintenance of discipline and the training of character. The authorities of a college should be solely and wholly responsible for the internal discipline of a college, and the bonds between the Professors and pupils should in no case get weakened. It is the personality of the teacher that, exercises the most potent influence over the character and manners as well as the intellect of the pupil. It would be a misfortune if this influence became less for any reason.</p>
		<p>It is often asked what is a University and what are its functions. Cardinal Newman in his eloquent language gives a definition which can bear repetition:</p>
		<p>"If I were asked to describe as briefly and popularly as I could what a University was, I should draw my answer from its ancient designation of a <em>Studium Generale,</em> or 'School of Universal Learning'. This description implies﻿ the assemblage of strangers from all parts in one spot <em>from all parts;</em> else, how will you find professors and students · for every department of knowledge? and in one spot; else, how can there by any school at all? Accordingly, in its simple and rudimental form, it is a school of knowledge of every kind, consisting of teachers and learners from every quarter. Many things are requisite to complete and satisfy the idea embodied in this description; but such as this a University seems to be in its essence, a place for the communication and circulation of thought, by means of personal intercourse, through a wide extent of country.... A University is the place to which a thousand schools make contributions; in which the intellect may safely range and speculate, sure to find its equal in some antagonist activity, and its judge in the tribunal of truth. It is a place where inquiry is pushed forward, and discoveries verified and perfected, and rashness rendered innocuous, and error exposed, by the collision of mind with mind, and knowledge with knowledge. It is the place where the Professor becomes eloquent, and is a missionary and a preacher, displaying his science in its most complete and most winning form, pouring it forth with the zeal of enthusiasm, and lighting up his own love of it in the breasts of his hearers. It is the place where the catechist makes good the ground as he goes, treading in the truth day by day into the ready memory, and wedging and tightening it into the expanding reason. It is a place which wins the admiration of the young by its celebrity, kindles the﻿ affections of the middle-aged by its beauty, and rivets the fidelity of the old by its associations. It is a seat of wisdom, a light of the world, a minister of the faith, an <em>Alma Mater</em> of the rising generation. It is this and a great deal more and demands a somewhat better head and hand than mine to describe it well."</p>
		<p>Although in the above definition a University is defined as <em>Studium Generale,</em> that is, a School of Universal Learning, it does not follow that every University should teach every subject. The expanse of knowledge is so wide, the number of sciences and their sub-divisions is so large that it is impossible for any University in the world to attempt to teach them all, and the resources of no State would suffice to maintain such a University. For a new University like Mysore, which is not endowed but is maintained wholly by the State, it is safest to limit its functions at first to an irreducible minimum of subjects. We must have Languages and their Literatures; in our case English, Sanskrit, Persian, Kannada, other Vernaculars and French; we must have History, both Ancient and Modern, Philosophy, Mathematics, and Physics and Chemistry. We have already in addition to this irreducible minimum of subjects Economics, Commerce, Engineering and the natural sciences of Geology and Botany.</p>
		<p>It is no doubt, a disadvantage that the departments of Science and the Humanities in the Mysore University are placed at a great distance from one another and constant intercourse between students of both departments is not﻿ possible. There is no advantage so great in a University as the constant interchange of thought between students of Science and Engineering on the one hand and those of Literature, Philosophy and History on the other. A means of lessening this disadvantage is to bring about friendly meetings in rival contests of games, debates, lectures, and social gatherings. A social week in Bangalore and another in Mysore in different parts of the year for the students of both sections would combine pleasure with instruction. Such interchange of ideas removes narrowmindedness, broadens the intellectual outlook, and produces a real world of culture and liberal learning.</p>
		<p>Everywhere the addition of new subjects to the programme of studies depends on various circumstances, on geographical position, on a donor appearing with a handsome endowment, on an eminent teacher rising in our midst to whom students flock in large numbers and who can lead them on to advanced studies and research. As for endowments India is essentially a poor country, and we have hardly any Rockfellers or Carnegies among us. The Calcutta University is the only University in India which has been fortunate enough under the enthusiastic advocacy of Sir Asutosh Mookerjee to obtain large endowments from leaders of the bar and from Zemindars of Bangal. Even Bombay with its merchant princes has not shown yet anything more than a long list of scholarships and prizes as Mysore has already begun to show. But scholarships and prizes are not endowments for chairs, laboratories and﻿ libraries. Until the endowments come the expansion of the University has to wait, unless the State can, without injury to other interests, spare more funds and can take up the additional burden. But when they come sooner or later as they are bound to do in the case of Universities admittedly doing good work, the choice of new subjects will depend upon various circumstances, geographical, economical and social. In the case, however, of subjects like mining and metallurgy it would perhaps be more advantageous to found scholarships to enable selected students eto go to well-equipped European Universities of established reputation in the teaching of mining and metallurgy like Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, or to America than to have costly technological departments of our own. Agriculture and the sugar industry which are of great importance to the country should claim the first attention and also suitable subjects of applied chemistry like the chemistry of fats and oils, lac industry, of dyes, gums, resins and varnishes, etc. With the Indian Institute of Science close at hand which is handsomely aided by the Mysore State, important help can always be obtained in technological subjects from that Institute which is being re-organized at present on improved lines.</p>
		<p>Before the further addition of other faculties and subjects to be taught by the University is discussed, it is to be hoped that the question of having honours courses separate from those of the ordinary degree in Arts and Science will be taken up in eamest. I believe it has﻿ been to some extent already discussed. But unless a clear distinction is made between the courses for an ordinary degree and those for an honours degree, the student of exceptional talents will not be distinguished from another of average abilities, nor can the former be encouraged to do his best without such differentiation. Such a want of opportunity to excel given to students of excellent abilities is so much loss to the University and the country. The Madras University has set a most admirable example by providing honours courses which may be followed in Mysore. Moreover, research work and training in the methods of research are the most important functions of a University which are best carried out when there are honours courses.</p>
		<p>Though the number of faculties and subjects may perforce have to be limited in a young University, what is perhaps the most important aspect of University education must not be undervalued or forgotten. University teaching especially in a unitary University like Mysore exercises a most powerful influence on the character and manners of the students. It is the character-forming influence of University education which is perhaps its most valuable part. A student may not on leaving the University find lucrative work which will rapidly advance his material interests, but his help and company will be sought after as of one who can always be relied upon, whose character is unimpeachable, whose lofty aims, self-sacrifice and readiness to help his neighbours and hatred of all meanness distinguish him from his less fortunate brethern. A residential and﻿ unitary University gives such scope to high-minded professors and tutors for the exercise of elevating influence on their pupils' character and manners as cannot be found in any other educational institution. These influences exercised in an unobtrusive way leave a stamp on the mind and manners of young men which lasts a life-time. It is in the University that young men have an opportunity of learning industrious and persevering habits, and that intense love of work which ensures their success in life. It is in the University that they receive those humanizing influences which broaden their outlook on life, and give such an insight into human nature as renders them worthy leaders of men in future. The material result of University education at the commencement of life may be small, but their moral elevation is their best reward. I am glad to say that the educated Mysorean is already making a good name for himself in other parts of the country. Respectful, obedient and of gentle manners he has by this keen sense of duty and devotion to work already won golden opionions wherever he has found work..</p>
		<p>There is no doubt that our educated men have often long to wait for adequate recognition of their merits from a material point of view in a poor country like India. The number of careers open to the best products of University education in India compared to those open to similar men in more advanced countries are, it must be admitted, very few, and cause anxiety to them and their parents who at great sacrifice have given them higher education. Until﻿ the economic state of the country improves by the development of trade and industries, the opportunities of fairly remunerative employment will, I fear, remain limited. The University cannot increase these opportunities. It can only help to a limited extent by shaping its courses of instruction so that they may suit the nature of employment in trade and industry. While a highly educated Englishman can find a career in the Church or the Army or in the higher administrative branches of the public service both at home and abroad, Indian youths have no similar openings. The higher grades of Engineering, Medical and Civil Services are in British India mostly filled by Englishmen. In an enlightened Native State like Mysore, however, the higher grades of service are happily open to Indians of high education, but the number of well-paid posts is necessarily limited in the State. The only careers usually open to an ordinary graduate are the lower grades of the Civil and Administrative services, at the bar, and in the Judicial, Public Works, Medical and Educational Departments, and in other kinds of work which require literary ability and high character.</p>
		<p>In industrial concerns there is a popular prejudice, which is often justified by facts, that a highly educated man is unpractical and not suitable for employment. Want of manual training in the education received at school is often his misfortune. A natural or inherited dislike of practical work which requires the ready use of hands is a great hindrance to admission to the avenues of industry, Unless such a man begins his career on the lowest rung﻿ of the ladder, he gets no chance of rising in industrial pursuits. But when once he has established his footing he can rise rapidly by his intelligence, ability and character above a number of ill-educated competitors. It is false pride often to refuse to make a modest beginning. Most young men have to learn that though they may be trained in theoretical science, in all industries requiring practical skill they have to commence work low down in a factory The scientific training gives him an advantage over uneducated workmen, and he understands the reason of every process and can use his resourcefulness in time of need, he rapidly proves his superiority and may rise in a short time to the highest controlling post from very modest beginnings. This is a lesson in life which most of our educated men ambitious of a practical career have yet to learn.</p>
		<p>Distinguished students in Europe and America on completing their courses of higher engineering studies at a University find it necessary to pay high premia of two to three hundred pounds a year for two or three years in order to apprentice themselves in great engineering or manufacturing works to acquire practical experience, and in such works they commence in the lowest grade and rise step by step through all the stages of work. It is such men that achieve success in their profession. During this apprenticeship they are subjected to severe discipline and have to obey the orders of their superiors implicitly although these orders may have the appearance of being﻿ inconsistent with the theoretical teaching they have had at College. They also learn how to handle labour as they rise to positions of responsibility, in which they have to control the actions of other workmen, and at the same 2 time they acquire tact in dealing with their associates as well as their superiors. A man who is always at variance with his colleagues cannot be chosen by his superiors to fill positions of trust and responsibility. It will thus be seen how essential practical training is and how a successful industrialist should acquire all these practical e qualifications after completing his theoretical course. It is true that great Engineering Works are few in number in India and earnest students may have to go to Europe or America for such apprenticeship. But the best use should be made of the existing works in India.</p>
		<p>What is true of engineering students is also true of scientific students who are eager to rise in industrial pursuits. And the same thing is imutatis mutandis true of the literary scholars turned out by the University. They have to commence life in these days of keen competition in humble positions in the hope of future advancement unless they are blessed with meanse which make them independent. The struggle in life is growing on every side and in a poor country like India it is at its worst.</p>
		<p>I refer to the difficulties of finding a ready career immediately after completing a course of University education, even in the case of those who have gone through a highly scientific training, not with any idea of discouraging the﻿ students but only as a warning against possible disappointment, and to invite attention to remedies or rather palliative measures under the existing circumstances. There is nowhere in India such eager desire to obtain the highest education obtainable as there is among the people of Mysore, because the intellectual classes have no other avenue to success in life except through higher education. Mysore being an inland Province has hardly any commerce, all its trade being an exchange of its raw products with neighbouring parts for what is necessary to supply its limited wants. Industries have not been developed and the country on the whole is poor, and its, wants are few. Under such circumstances higher education is the only resort of ambitious young men. The lure of higher education attracts all men that possess some ability, and consequently there is a tremendous rush of students knocking at the door of the University for admission. The numbers of students in the Maharaja's College and the Central College which were 275 and 313 in 1916-17 have risen in five years to 518 and 359 respectively, the admission into the science classes of the Central College being necessarily restricted on account of the limited accommodation for practical work in the laboratories. The strength of the Engineering College which was 45 in 1917-18 has increased in the short space of four years to 156 in 1921-22. The Entrance Examination of the Mysore University was held for the first time in 1917 when the number of candidates was 244 of whom 120 were declared to have passed. The corresponding figures in 1921 were 1,029 and 287. If the increase proceeds at the present rate, it will soon become impossible to give admission to even half the number seeking it. It might be of use to inquire what remedies or palliatives can be found for the present state of things. One way would be to add to the number of Faculties by adding Medicine and Law as soon as may be convenient. The Medical Colleges of other parts of India are already unable to admit Mysorean students as all their available accommodation s. required for local men. How far funds would be available for such expansion of the work of the University is a question for the administrative authorities of the State to solve. In considering the answer to this question it will have to be borne in mind that all departments of education, University, High, Middle and Primary, should proceed with equal step, no one department being favoured at the cost of the others. Another and perhaps more effective remedy would be to turn the present Collegiate High Schools into Intermediate Colleges by adding one more year to the course of study in the Collegiate Schools. The Intermediate Colleges would be formed of four classes, the present fifth and sixth forms and two College classes. The Entrance Examination would mark the completion of the Intermediate College course, while the S.S.L.C. Ex-, amination would mark the completion of the course ending with the sixth form. When the Intermediate Colleges are formed it should be possible to start alternative classes from the fifth form upwards, three periods in the morning being devoted to such cultural subjects as are necessary for all pupils, and the whole afternoon being devoted in the case of some pupils to academical subjects and in the case of others to special or vocational subjects and workshop practice, which would fit the pupils •for practical work and a career in life without having to proceed to the University. Such alternative subjects might be various, and should include agriculture the chief industry of India, mechanical and civil engineering in their lower branches, training for a lower teacher's diploma than the B.T. Degree, domestic science for girls, commercial training, training for telegraphists and for police duty, etc. The number of vocational subjects may be increased from time to time as need is felt. As many of the vocational courses of the Intermediate Colleges may be co-ordinated with higher University teaching as possible, to encourage a few select lads to proceed to the University if they are deserving. Such co-ordination would be easy to make when there are Colleges of University status teaching the same subjects. Thus the Intermediate Colleges would provide education for a large number of young men who have not the abilities or the means of proceeding to the University but prefer to go into active life from the Intermediate College or High School. Along with the formation and expansion of Technical Instruction with graded institutions from Taluk and District schools to a Technological Institute, in which whole-time instruction is given in technical subjects with workshop practice, may be instituted. To work out schemes of this kind will require time, experience and a heavy outlay. Yet it is worth while by offering alternative courses to boys of average abilities to check the present rush to the University and reserve University Education for young men of the highest capacities and for those who desire high education in cultural subjects, and have independent means and leisure.</p>
		<p>Similarly for women a graded scheme in subjects of domestic science from middle schools upwards to the University can be arranged. Your learned Vice-Chancellor referred to this subject in his address last year. It would be wrong to consider that subjects of domestic science are not worthy of taking a place in University education. When it is considered that women's chief function in life is that of maker of the home and man's chief happiness is found in a well-ordered home, any teaching which fits a woman to be a model wife and mother would be welcomed by Indian women who are unsurpassed in dovotion to their duties. The humbler duties of cookery and laundry work may be taught in middle schools for girls by practical lessons while subjects like 'hygiene, home-nursing and economics, etc., may be taught in Girls' High Schools. In the University a higher course worthy of it can be arranged for women in select portions of applied chemistry, sanitary science, applied hygiene. bacteriology, general biology, and physics with practical demonstrations and experiments, in economics of the household, in general and child psychology and ethics. There is quite enough of cultural and scientific﻿ training for women in a course like this to make it equal to an advanced course for men. A department for the education of women built up gradually from below is what is wanted for giving an impetus and right direction to women's education in Mysore. When the Maharani's College was started forty years ago by a few enthusiasts there were hardly two or three good middle schools for girls in the Province. Its establishment was evidently much too premature.</p>
		<p>Graduates of the Mysore University of 1922, I congratulate you on your success in the University examinations and hope and trust that it will be a precursor of equally great success in life. You have received an education, which is second to none obtainable in India, by the enlightened liberality of His Highness the Maharaja. You have given proofs of your industry and more than average abilities by passing your examinations. The culture and the training of character you have received will make you useful and enlightened subjects of His Highness, and I hope you will make worthy use of your opportunities in a way that will reflect credit on your University. You have taken a solemn obligation to-day to uphold and advance social order and the well-being of your fellow-men. This is a comprehensive obligation. Your first duty is to be hearty and firm in your loyalty to your' Maharaja and the State that have done so much for your enlightenment, culture and happiness. If the spirit of unrest that has spread to a considerable extent in other parts of India find entrance into the State,﻿ it will be your duty to fight against it and prevent it from contaminating the ingenuous minds of the people of this Province. And further it is your duty to preach and implant in the minds of all Mysoreans loyalty to the suzerain power under whose protection and by whose generous guidance and help the State that has educated you has flourished But you have sworn also to uphold and advance social order and well-being of your fellow-men. By your education you will be centres of light wherever fortune may place you. You have knowledge, your judgement has been cultivated, and you are able to decide what is right from what is wrong, what is proper from what is improper. You have also under the humanising influences of the University leamt to sympathize with your less fortunate brethern, to understand their weaknesses and deficiencies and appreciate their just hopes and aspirations. It will be your duty to guide them by your wisdom, and help them by your knowledge to fulfil their righteous aspirations. You will see around you a vast amount of ignorance, prejudice and blind adherence to long-established usage which may have had a justification in ages long gone by, but which cannot suit the presnt enlightened times. It will be your duty with your wider knowledge and keener judgement to lead he blind and the ignorant into the right path and persuade them to adopt reforms that would increase their happiness. You should make the cause of popular education your own, and give your personal help in spreading Primary education among children and especially in helping the cause of adult education among the people around you. On local and municipal boards your active work will be required. By your generous sympathies and help you can bring enlightenment into many dark nooks, and happiness into the lives of your unfortunate fellow-men. For these unselfish services the State that has educated you has claims upon you, and you will increase your own happiness by performing them. Your joy and satisfaction in helping others will make you happier. In whatever you do always entertain high motives, suppress ungenerous and mean feelings, and be always ready to render service to others, while not neglecting your own interests or those of the people nearest you. I wish you all success and prosperity in your future life.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the University of Mysore on 24th October, 1923 by Sir P.S. Sivaswamy Aiyar, K.C.S.I., C.I.E.</h1>
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESS, MR. VICE-CHANCELLOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>When the gracious wish of His Highness the Maharaja was conveyed to me that I should deliver the customary address on this occasion, I felt it to be my duty to comply with the request of a prince whom I have had the honour and privilege of knowing for several years and for whom I cherish feelings of high esteem and admiration as the enlightened ruler of a model State and for his virtues alike in public and private life. While I am deeply sensible of the honour conferred by the Maharaja's choice, I am even more sensible of its onerous character and of the difficulties of the task. The topics covered by a Convocation address are more or less hackneyed and it is hardly possible to discover any topics which have not already been dwelt upon in this University or in the sister Universities of India. The rule of your University which requires an address suitable to the occasion is somewhat different in its terms from the rule of the Madras University which prescribes that the address should exhort the graduates to conduct themselves suitably unto the position to which they have attained by their respective degrees. I have﻿ no qualifications or experience as an educational expert. My only claim to a hearing is my connection with the Madras University for a period of twenty years and a year's connection with the Hindu University of Benares and the interest which I have naturally taken in university affairs. I shall therefore avail myself of the latitude of your rule and claim your indulgence in the observations I am about to make.</p>
		<p>At the time when the Government of Mysore decided to sever the affiliation of its colleges to the University of Madras and found a university of its own, I happened to be the Vice-Chancellor of the Madras University. There were doubts and misgivings in some quarters as to the preparedness of Mysore for an independent university of its own, but I never entertained any such doubts or misgivings myself and was optimistic about its success. Apart from the question as to the suitability of the affiliating type of university and apart from the question whether the Madras University had changed its character at all even in respect of the colleges situate within the metropolitan area, I had long entertained the conviction that a single university for the whole of the area comprised within the jurisdiction of the Madras University was too unwieldy for the purposes of the examining type and too inadequate for the purposes of the teaching type. Judging with reference to the area of Southern India, the strength of its population and the languages spoken by it and considering the provision for university education in Western countries, there could﻿ be no question as to the desirability, nay the necessity, of having several universities in place of one. The only limitations upon the creation of new universities, whether of a regional type or of a more comprehensive character, are those imposed by finance, or the available supply of cultured men to participate in and carry on the administration of the university. While difficulties of this character form insuperable impediments to the creation of new universities in the Madras Presidency, there was no reason to apprehend that they would constitute a serious obstacle to a university located in the headquarters of the premier Indian State in Southern India. The example of Mysore and the policy of the new Madras University Act have set the Travancore Government seriously thinking of the formation of a university to subserve the needs of the Kerala region. There is reason to hope that the University of Travancore may also come into existence in the near future.</p>
		<p>The reasons for the multiplication of universities are the extension of educational facilities and the adaptation of the character of education to the varying requirements and ideals of different regions. In bringing the University of Mysore into existence it was the intention of your Government not to reproduce the pattern of the University of Madras to which the colleges were affiliated but to start a residential and teaching university with special features of its own. The payment of greater attention to the vernaculars, the promotion of the corporate life of the university, the institution of extension lectures and of a Publication Bureau were﻿ intended to be some of the new features of your university. The reduction of the university course by a year and the corresponding extension of the high school course by a year was one of the important features of this university. In introducing this change this university anticipated in some measure one of the important recommendations of the Calcutta University Commission. One of the main defects noticed by the. Sadler Commission in the system of high school education in India was that the course of instruction provided in the secondary schools was an inadequate foundation for the university and that the Intermediate classes of the colleges were making an inefficient attempt to supplement the instruction provided by the secondary schools. They recommended that this duty of supplementing the instruction furnished by the secondary schools should be transferred to Intermediate colleges and that the length of the ordinary degree course of the university should be reduced to three years. In providing for a year's course in your collegiate high schools as a preparation for entrance to the university the object evidently has been to maintain the length of the period required for the university degree at four years from the completion of the secondary school course. Judging from our experience of the secondary schools and Arts colleges in Madras, the recommendation of the Sadler Commission appeared to me to be thoroughly justified, even though it increased the length of the period required for﻿ an ordinary degree to five years. In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the training afforded by our secondary schools and in view also of the fact that the Intermediate course is a preparation and a starting point for several professional courses, the course of two years at an Intermediate college or institution would appear none too long for the purpose it is intended to fulfil. The experience of Mysore with regard to the working and results of the collegiate school course must be of considerable value and interest to the educational authorities in the Madras Presidency and other parts of British India. In regard to the other objects set forth as the special features of the University, I presume that they are being attained in gradually increasing measure. There is evidence of original work being done both in the Science Department and in the Department of Kannada Literature and the activities of the Publication Bureau seem to have been maintained, notwithstanding the restriction imposed by temporary financial stringency. The number of students on the rolls of university colleges during the last year is said to have been a little over a thousand. The deficiency in the strength of the colleges as compared with those in Madras need not cause any dissatisfaction, as it permits of greater attention to individual students and closer personal intimacy between the teaching staff and the students. The success of the university is not to be judged by the numbers of its students or merely by the results of the public examinations. Quality, not quantity, should be the aim of all genuine university work.﻿</p>
		<p>The facile task of suggesting new lines of activity and new developments is superfluous in the case of a university under the guidance of a distinguished and versatile scholar like your Vice-Chancellor who is thoroughly familiar with the requirements and ideals of modem universities. The task would also be otiose, as all ambitious schemes are stranded on the shoals of finance. Many things might be suggested in the way of opening new professional colleges, new departments of the Arts and Science Faculties, art schools, art galleries and museums, providing facilities for research work in various departments, popularizing knowledge by courses of extension lectures and publishing original works and translations. But. all such schemes are severely limited by financial considerations and I have no doubt that the Government of this state would only be too glad to initiate new lines of work if they were in a position to provide more funds. The expenditure on university education by the Government of Mysore in proportion to its finances is perhaps too low. There are no theoretical limits to the expenditure of money on university education. The authorities of the University of Liverpool with their annual income and expenditure of over £230,000 complain of inadequacy of funds. The University of Chicago spends over 3 million dollars a year and the Harvard University which spends more than 5 million dollars per annum would like to spend much more. Before starting work on new fields it would be rather desirable to consolidate the work already undertaken in the different branches of learning﻿ in which university education is now provided and see that the institutions now in existence discharge their functions as efficiently as possible. It is only six years since the University was started, but short as the period may be, there is no ground for dissatisfaction with the work so far accomplished. Our opinion as to the progress in education made in this country must necessarily be determined by the ideals we entertain as to the purpose of education. I doubt whether there has been really any serious difference of opinion on this point among the people or between the Government and the people. The ideals of a course of university education must be to train the mind, character and physique of the students, so that they may develop their faculties to the fullest extent, to impart culture and breadth of outlook, to inculcate patriotism and the duties of citizenship, to enable them to raise the level of national efficiency and national welfare and to contribute to the advancement of knowledge. These ideals may or may not have been realized by our universities. The methods pursued may have been faulty and the objects may have been but very imperfectly attained. The political ferment in India has directed men's attention to the question of education among others and the desire for national education has often taken curious shapes and led to a movement for a boycott of schools and colleges maintained or supported by the Government. There can be no doubt that the movement has been inspired rather by a destructive spirit than by any sound conception of the aims and methods of education.</p>﻿ 
		<p>education is so large that it cannot possibly be solved except by the use of State funds. There need be no qualms of conscience about resort to institutions maintained or supported by the State when the funds are raised by taxation from the people themselves. As put by a recent nationalist writer on this subject, "Is it the language which is the medium of instruction which makes it national or the agency through which it is imparted or the agency which controls and regulates it or the books which are taught or the standards and ideals which underlie it?" If the level of national efficiency and well-being is to be raised, India cannot afford to cut herself adrift from the currents of modern thought and modern science and knowledge and the only sane course for her is to follow the example of the most powerful nation in the East and to learn and assimilate all that is good and worth knowing in the culture and civilization of the West. In the words of the writer already referred to, "It will be folly and madness to try to discourage the study and dissemination of European languages, European literatures and European sciences in India." Nor can India afford to resort to womout methods of education which, whatever value they might have possessed in ancient times, are no longer suitable to the new conditions. There are many among our people who consider that our schools and colleges are too expensive institutions for a poor country and that a reversion to the methods of the ancient <em>pathasalas</em> is necessary. Far be it from me to deny the good features of the old system of instruction by the <em>guru</em> to the <em>chelas</em> in his own house or in the village. But let us see what the old method involved. Taking, for instance, the life laid down by <em>Apastambha</em> for a student, it was a life of more than Spartan severity, of asceticism and aloofness from the world. The mind of the student was looked upon as a wayward thing to be crushed by an iron discipline and drilled into conformity rather than as a tender plant requiring the most genial surroundings and influences for its nurture and growth. The psychological problems of the juvenile mind were unknown and the theory of education was that knowledge should be poured into the mind to be retained and reproduced when necessary. As a preparation for the world and the struggles of life, and its temptations and dangers, as a means of cultivating initiative, resourcefulness and a spirit of enterprise, as an instrument of education in the amenities of social life and the knowledge of human nature, the system was bound to fail. The value of the moral discipline it imparted was discounted by the fact that it was adapted not to the ordinary surroundings of society in which the student would have to play a part in after-life but a highly artificial surroundings of a monastic character. The classical story of Rishyasringa who succumbed to temptation at the first contact with the world of realities is an excellent illustration of the liability to a breakdown of the moral discipline enforced by the old system. Can there be any doubt that the English public school produces a much more virile character, with habits of self-reliance and independence﻿ or that it instils the spirit of patriotism, or promotes a love of sports and athletics and a spirit of adventure and of courage, or equips the students with a considerable knowledge of human nature and society. <em>The Gurukula</em> at Kangri is perhaps the only institution which is modelled upon the old system of guru and chela and which also seeks to impart some of the elements of Western knowledge. But to the extent that it enforces monastic ideals, it must be held that the training given by the institution is illadapted to modern conditions of life. That some of the objects aimed at by the <em>Gurukula</em> system are worthy of praise cannot be denied. I am aware that the <em>Gurukula</em> at Kangri has elicited tributes of appreciation from various quarters, European and Indian, as an attempt to preserve what is good in the ancient methods of education. The spirit of reverence and devotion to the teacher, the vow of chastity, the love of simplicity and the habit of selfcontrol are traits worthy of admiration, but we must not suppose that these virtues cannot be adquired in schools conducted according to Western methods or acquired at too heavy a price. Even taking the ancient ideals of education at their best, it may fairly be said that their tendency on the whole was the promotion of respect for authority rather than the encouragement of intellectual freedom. We know that in the field of metaphysical speculation no country in the world has produced more independent and fearless thinkers than India. We know also that even in the case of the Vedas, the infallibility of which is an article﻿ of creed in the orthodox world, they have been eviscerated by interpretation by the Mimamsakas on the one hand and by the Vedantins on the other, till we have only a shell of formal ritualism and a nucleus of a Parabrahma left behind. Generalization has its dangers but very genera statement must be understood subject to qualification. There can be no doubt in the mind of an impartial investigator, that the inculcation of submission to authority is a characteristic of the national system of education in India. In fact, it is one of the precepts to be observed by a pupil that he should not contradict his teacher.</p>
		<p>The sphere of education is not the only one in which there is a conflict between the ideals of the old world and those of the modern. In many an other department of our social and intellectual life there is a similar conflict of ideals between the East and the West. Conflicts of this character between old and new ideals, between authority and freedom, between religion and science are not peculiar to this country. They have been experienced in the West also and they have been or are being solved in some way satisfactory or otherwise. The peculiarity about the conflict of ideals in the mind of the educated Indian of the present day is that it is not a case of collision between ideas of the same or similar national origin, but a collision between the indigenous culture of the land and the foreien culture of the West. Patriotic, historical and evolutional considerations enter the arena and affect the issue. The complete adoption of the Western ideal looks like treachery to one's own country and disloyalty to the spirit of the nation and of the past. On the other hand, a stolid adherence to old ideals and a refusal to assimilate what is best in the culture of the West is a handicap in the struggle for existence. Some adjustment is obviously necessary between the old and the new ideas if we are to adapt ourselves to the changed conditions of the world and maintain our national individuality. Not merely is such adjustment necessary in the interests of our national progress, but it is equally required in the interests of individual happiness and peace of mind. Even among the educated classes, there are some who give no thought to the claims of these divergent ideals, who are assailed by no doubts as to the wisdom of the past and who fail to realize the demands of the present. A spirit of placid conservatism is the attitude of one section of our countrymen. A contemptuous disregard for the past and an unqualified admiration for the whole and every item of Western civilization is the attitude of another section. Yet another section leads a life of double personality, leading two parallel lives without feeling the necessity for any logical coherence of beliefs. It was remarked of a certain class of persons by Herbert Spencer that when they entered their oratory they closed the door of their laboratory and when they entered their laboratory they closed the door of their oratory. There are, however, large numbers of us who feel the force of the impact between the old and new ideas and the only solution which is practicable is for each one of us to attempt a synthesis to the best of our lights between the divergent ideals, to follow a policy of eclecticism and pick up whatever is best in the culture of the East and of the West and is best calculated to improve the efficiency of the nation and the happiness of its citizens. In illustration of my remarks, I may be permitted to refer to a few such cases of divergence between the old and the new ideals. Let us take, for instance, the ideals of marriage in ancient India at their best and the relations between the husband and the wife. Marriages were settled for the bridegroom: and the bride and the choice of the parties themselves counted for little or nothing. Exceptions were no doubt allowed in the case of the Kshatriyas who were permitted to contract a marriage in the Gandharva form, but the ordinary rule was for the parents to choose and for the children to accept the decision. This practice has continued to the present day and the objectionable features have assumed much larger dimensions. With the growing practice of postponing the age of marriage both on account of the difficulty of securing bridegrooms and the growing desire to give some education to girls, it is obvious that the wishes of the parties themselves to a marriage must be allowed a very much larger share in the transaction, even if they are not allowed to become the decisive factor. Take again the duties of the wife to the husband as laid down in our epics and in the Dharma Shastras. The husband, was the lord and master, if not also a God to his wife and even a wife like Sita was said to have followed her﻿ husband as his shadow. However flattering and acceptable the ideal may be to the majority of the male sex, is it likely to be acceptable to the educated woman anxious to secure opportunities for self-realization and development, who cannot blind herself 'to the faults and the defects of her husband and is unable to detect any presence of the divine element in him and recognizes perhaps all too painfully that he is a mere man with perhaps more than his share of the faults of his sex? Is not the ideal of a partnership on equal terms more consistent with the dignity of woman, more conducive to mutual esteem and good-will and domestic happiness and more likely to be in accord with the changing conditions of the future?</p>
		<p>Let us turn again to the question of filial obedience. No nobler picture of filial obedience has ever been conceived than that of Rama who undertook an exile to the forest for a term of fourteen years to enable his old father to redeem a thoughtless promise made to a young wife. As a Hindu myself I feel fascinated by the picture and feel that no true Hindu can resist the appeal of this charming picture. I know also that our literature loves to teach Dharma by the use of hyperbolic stories; but is it an ideal which is practicable at the present time, or can it be laid down that it is the duty of a son to obey every unreasonable wish of his father, provided it is not sinful? We have another illustration of an extreme case in the story of Parasurama who beheaded his mother at the instance of his father, because she had admired the passing form﻿ of a Gandharva. Let us take again the old ideal of a Hindu joint family with the mutual obligations of the members to support each other and the training it afforded in habits of altruism and its comparative disregard of the rights of the female members of the family. To some, it may appear as a satisfactory compromise between extreme individualism and the communistic principle. On the other hand, is not the Dayabhaga system of law which abolishes survivorship a more satisfactory scheme and is it not better adapted to modern conditions? Turning to the political sphere, is not the theory of the divine right of the sovereign which is laid down in our Dharma Shastra and which has been asserted or recognized in other countries as well, an outworn fiction which can no longer serve any purpose in advanced countries?</p>
		<p>Passing from the question of the double personality in the mental sphere of the educated Hindu, let us cast a glance at the double life led by many an Indian inside his home and outside. There is a want of accord between the ideas and beliefs of the educated Indian and those of his womenfolk. Inside his house he leads a life of conformity to traditional practices and observances which have lost their meaning for him but still retain a hold on the women. He acquiesces with an air partly of amusement and partly of resignation, in their forms of worship, in their religious ceremonies and in their methods of nursing and bringing up children. He lacks the pleasures of intellectual companionship, but he sometimes feels that his women﻿ are the sanctuary of his religion and that they make up by their faith and devotion for his own want of religion, or of conformity. He has a vague fear that the idyllic atmosphere of his home may be disturbed by female education, but however charming it may be, it is rather an atmosphere of racial childhood. There is no other way to get rid of this double life than by the education of women, not necessarily on identical lines with that for men (except, of course, for those who intend to follow the learned professions), but on lines more appropriate to the sphere of their duties and functions at home and in society. The alteration required in the higher educational courses for women will, I hope, engage the early attention of this University if it has not already done so. The defects in the existing system of education have all been pointed out in the Report of the Calcutta University Commission, a mine of educational experience and wisdom and and the suggestions for improvement which it contains are practically applicable to the universities of Southeren Indian quite as much as to Calcutta.</p>
		<p>One of the important functions of a university is the advancement of knowledge by the encouragement of original research. The only university which has so far provided facilties for research is the University of Calcutta. Thanks to the energy, zeal and far-sighted and broadminded patriotism of Sir Asutosh Mukherji, the University of Calcutta has made provision for an elaborate scheme of post-graduate studies in a variety of subjects and the University College of Science has won a name for itself in the scientific world by the contributions of its professors and advanced students who are all Indians. In Mysore you possess the inestimable advantage of the best-equipped institute of science in the whole of India and graduates of Mysore who have got an aptitude for research can avail themselves of the facilities of the Indian Institute of Science. The addition of new departments to this Institute cannot be beyond the resources of the authorities now co-operating in its mainteance and it may perhaps be a satisfactory and less expensive alternative to the university undertaking the encouragement of scientific research entirely on its own account. Whether there are any administrative or other obstacles to such a course, I do not know. Let us hope that the Iron Works at Bhadravati will prove a successful venture and create a demand for experts in mining and metallurgy and that the increased prosperity of the finances of Mysore will enable the Government to establish technical colleges in mining and metallurgy as well as other subjects of a regional character.</p>
		<p>Attached to the University of Madras, training corps have been formed both in Madras and in Trichinopoly as part of the scheme of the Indian Territorial Force. The advisability of forming a similar university training corps in Bangalore and Mysore may well be considered by the Government, more especially as the presence of a large military force in Bangalore, with its complement of officers should facilitate the necessary arrangements for instruction and training.﻿</p>
		<p>Of those who have taken your degrees to-day, some will probably think of prosecuting further studies of a specialized character, either with a view to acquiring professional knowledge or with a view to the attainment of a higher standard of knowledge in subjects already studied by you. Others will probably be obliged to think of some career and earn their living. Some of you, at any rate, may have discovered your special aptitudes and directed your studies accordingly and I hope you will all succeed in the careers to which you may be called. But whatever may be your special callings, you will have to discharge your duties as citizens of the State. Opportunities for participation in public life are daily expanding, whether in the sphere of local or central government, both in Mysore and in British India. The Constitutional Reforms which have been foreshadowed by His Highness' Government will open more largely the avenues of political life. The satisfactory discharge of your duties to the State requires the formation of sound opinion on public questions and the proper guidance of public opinion. Constitutional advances in the direction of popular government require and pre-suppose the education of public opinion. The average elector in any country and still more in India is seldom sufficiently educated to form his own independent opinion on matters of public concern without assistance from those who are better qualified. If he is literate, he takes his opinions from the newspapers which fall into his hands. If he is illiterate, he has to depend upon the speeches of politicians which are open﻿ to his literate brethren also and upon second-hand accounts of the contents of newspapers. Opinions are largely swayed by the impressions received from these sources and by class or party interests. The responsibility of guiding public opinion which rests upon politicians and journalists can be adequately discharged only, if they make an honest and impartial endeavour to arrive at correct conclusions and in the interests of the country at large. Careful study of the question or policy at issue in all its bearings and the dispassionate examination of the arguments on one side and the other, and an honest attempt to understand the views of those who differ from you are the necessary preliminaries to a balanced judgement. The cultivation of a judicial frame of mind is essential to the formation of correct opinion, though it may disqualify you to some extent for partisanship. It may be urged that cultivation of the virtue of sobriety of judgement may result in loss of driving power and render a man unfit for participation in party struggles whether as a leader or as a follower. The party system is an unavoidable and essential feature of the system of parliamentary government and it may also at times prove necessary as a preparation for the development of the parliamentary system. But even in this view the formation of sound opinions is not a superfluity, which can be dispensed with. The interests of the State will be better served, if opinions are carefully formed and compromises are subsequently adopted in so far as they may be necessary for the reconcilement of divergent interests﻿ or for carrying through measures of great importance. This is not the place or the time to go into any detailed discussion of the ethics of the party system, the exigencies of parliamentary government, or the extent to which an honest politician may agree to a compromise. Conceding that a certain degree of narrowness of vision is necessary to make a successful party politician, which do you consider should give more satisfaction, the consciouness of having endeavoured to serve the country or to serve the party?</p>
		<p>Another piece of advice which I may give you is the necessity in political or other spheres of public life of division of labour and concentration of your attention and efforts upon particular subjects. If you are a member of a political body, it will not be possible for you to acquire a mastery of all the subjects that may engage the: attention of that body. If you are a public worker in the sphere of social welfare, it will not be possible for you to take equally active part in all social movements. While you may be ready to help many causes with your vote or your purse, you can acquire a close familiarity only with some of them. Division of labour is the essential condition of success in many spheres besides, the economic.</p>
		<p>Turning to the general public life of the country, one cannot help noticing with regret the signs of discord between rival creeds and communities and the bitterness of animosity which has been aroused in different parts of the country. The unity which was supposed to have been brought about between the Hindus and the Mussalmans﻿ three or four years ago rested upon the artificial foundation of a common hatred of British rule. A real rapprochment between the two great communities can only be achieved by an understanding and appreciation of each other's views and wishes and a spirit of mutual compromise and mutual reassurance. It is a remarkable and gratifying circumstance that violent disputes between rival creeds are of comparatively rare occurrence in the territories of the Indian princes. The causes of this happy state of affairs deserve study. Inter-communal differences unfortunately flourish even in your Province and it will be the duty of the educated classes to find ways and means of composing or reducing these differences as far as possible. In the Report on Constitutional Reforms in Mysore a device has been suggested in the method of representation of the interests of minorities with the object of attaining this end. Should this experiment be sanctioned the working of it will be watched with interest in British India and its results may prove of value to us. Your political problems are not exactly of the same character as those in British India. While there must be several common features, you must not lose sight of one fundamental difference between the conditions here and those in British India. The ruler and the subjects belong to the same race here and your progress will not be retarded by external influences having their origin in vested interests or in any want of insight and sympathy.</p>
		<p>Graduates of the University of Mysore, the degrees conferred upon you to-day are a recognition of your successful﻿ completion of a course of liberal education, but they do not mark the close of your education. This is a process which you have to carry on through life on the foundations laid here. Your Alma Mater is still very young, but is none the less entitled to your affection and reverence. The life you will lead, the ideals you entertain, the service you render to your fellow-citizens and to the State will help to form traditions, which will bring credit to your University and will be cherished by your successors. In return for the benefits you have received from the University you owe her an obligation to advance the cause of learning and education. Do not allow your bread-winning pursuits on of your activities or to absorb all your time and thoughts. Let your ideals be a pure and unsullied life with noble aims and a wise harmony of plan, an unabating ardour for knowledge, the cultivation of varied intellectual interests and the uplift of your country Disappointments there may be in the attainment of the objects we set before ourselves in life, but the consciousness of having striven for high ideals must bring a compensating measure of happiness. No higher ideal of culture, accomplishments, chivalry or service to the country has been conceived than that embodied by the first of Aryan poets in his pictures of Sri Rama. It is a most beautiful conception to my mind of perfect character or divinity as embodied in humanity. I have referred to Valmiki because I am more familiar with his work. But such ideals have their counterparts in other great religions also. Go forth into the world with the most cordial wishes of the University for your future welfare. May the Almighty shower His choicest blessings on you all and may the University of Mysore steadily expand its mission and its influence and take root in the affections of the people.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the University of Mysore by Dr. Annie Besant,D.L., on 29th October,1924</h1>
		<p>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS : YOUR HIGHNESS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>It is impossible for me to stand here to deliver the Convocation Address before the Chancellor and the University of Mysore, the first University founded in our own time by an Indian Ruler for the benefit of his people, without remembering that in the past of India the greatest and wisest of her monarchs found in the promotion of learning their noblest and most beneficent achievement, and saw in the foundation of a university the most enduring memorial of their thrones. Learning in India has ever been regarded as greater than wealth and rank, the fillet of wisdom as more worthy of reverence than the jewelled diadem of kings.</p>
		<p>Who does not remember how the famous Madura Sangam, as highest honour, tied round the head of a greatly learned man a fillet-like the laurel crown of Greece-placed him on a platform supported on poles, borne on the shoulders of men of learning, sometimes a king among them, and carried him in procession along the royal roads? In these days in which Indian women are recovering their ancient position, it may be worth while to note that not only do we come across the names of learned women, but that, as Professor S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar tells us:</p>    
		<p>A ruler of Tanjore, poet, musician, warrior and administrator, did extraordinary honour to a lady of the Court by name Ramachandramba, who composed an epic on the achievements of her patron, Raghunatha Nayaka of Tanjore. It appears she was a poetess of extraordinary powers, who could compose with equal facility in eight languages, and was accorded the honour of Kanakaratna Abhisheka (bath in gold and gems). She was, by assent of the Court, made to occupy the position of the "Emperor of learning," Kavita Sarvabhauma. <sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-02">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>That such honour was no ephemeral thing in India we may see if we recall the scene in the Royal University of Vikramasila, ten centuries later (founded by King Dharmapala of Gauda). When the University had gathered together to lend their Principal to Tibet, to bring about a revival of Buddhism there, the Tibetan envoy describes the waiting, and is eager to see the Sage, and he enquires whether one venerable Lama after another is not he. The Raja came "and took an exalted seat," but no monk rose to greet him. "When all the seats were filled up, there came Jovo Atisa, the Venerable of venerables, in all his glory, at whose sight the eyes felt no satiety."<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-03">**</a></sup></p>
		<p>Thoroughly do I believe the maxim, spoken by Professor Sidgwick to his University undergraduates: "If you would know what England can do, you must know what England has done in the past." To you I would say: "If you would know what India can do, you must know what India has done in the past." You have here, in the shaping, a young University, to bę moulded by Indian Ruler and Indian men of learning into what shape they will. Will you, I venture to ask you, make it only a copy, an imitation of Western Universities, or will you lift your eyes to the universities born on the Indian soil, breathing the Indian air, nourished by Indian traditions, and then set an example so inspiring that every great Indian State shall follow the example that you set, the example of the Ashramas and Sangams of the Hindu, the Viharas of the Buddhist. the Madrasahs of the Muslims?</p>
		<p>Even in such a record as <em>The Encylopaedia Britannica,</em> may be found an acknowledgment of the value of indigenous education in India, though not recording the splendour of its achievements. After mentioning the fact that "the existing system of education in India is mainly dependent upon the Government, being directly organized by the State, at least in its higher departments," the writer proceeds:</p>
		<p><small>At no period of its history has India been an altogether unenlightned country. The origin of the Deva-Nagari alphabet is lost in antiquity, though that is generally admitted not to be of indigenous invention. Inscriptions on stone and copper, the palmleaf records of the temples, and, in later days, the widespread manufacture of paper, all alike indicate not only the general knowledge, but also the common use of the art of writing. From the earliest times the caste of Brahmanas has preserved,﻿ by oral tradition as well as in manuscripts, a literature unrivalled alike in its antiquity and in the intellectual-subtlety of its contents. The Muhammadan invaders introduced the profession of the historian, which reached a high degree of excellence, even as compared with contemporary Europe. Through all changes of Government vernacular instruction in its simplest form has always been given, at least to the children of respectable classes, in every large village. On the one hand, the Toles, or seminaries for teaching Sanskrit philosophy at Benares and Nadiya, recall the schools of Athens and Alexandria; on the other, the importance attached to instruction in accounts reminds us of the picture which Herace has left of a Roman education. Even at the present day, knowledge of reading and writing is, owing to the teaching of Buddhist monks, as widely diffused throughout Burzaa as it is in some countries of Europe. English efforts to stimulate education have ever been most successful, when based upon the existing indigenous institutions.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-04">*</a></sup></small></p>
		<p>This is too much forgotten. Therefore, I ask you to wander with me for a short space in the forests of the Ashramas, the exquisite gardens of the Viharas, and let us see whether they do not present something that we may learn to utilize. We may consider the higher education in Ancient, Middle and Modern India, the Vaidic, the Buddhistic and the Muslim periods.</p>
		<p>Dr. Rabindranath Tagore has, in his Tapovana, striking passage on learning in Ancient India:</p>
		<p><small>A most wonderful thing that we notice in India is, that here the forest, not the town, is the fountain head of all its civilization.</small></p>
		<p><small>Wherever, in India, its earliest and most wonderful manifestations are noticed, we find that men have not come into such close contact as to be rolled or fused into a compact mass. There, trees and plante, rivers and lakes, had ample opportunity to live in close relationship with men.</small></p>
		<p><small>In these forests, though there was human society, "there was enough of open space, of dloofness; there was no jostling. Still, this aloofness did not produce inertness in the Indian mind; rather it rendered it all the brighter. It is the forest, that has nurtured the two great Ancient Ages of India, the Vaidic and the Budhistic.</small></p>
		<p><small>As did the Vaidic Rishis, Lord Buddha also showered His teaching in many woods > of India. The royal palace had no room for Him, it is the forest that took Him into its lap. The current of civilization that flowed from its forests inundated the whole of India.</small><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-05">*</a></sup></p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Hindu Age</strong></p>
		<p>It may be pointed out that the supreme literature of India, the Upanishads and the Brahma Sutras, are said to have been taught by sages and studied by reverent pupils, in these forest depths. For that supreme literature cannot be understood in its deepest meanings except with the aid of meditation and the discipline of the Raja Yoga. A teacher would give an aphorism, say, to his pupil, and send him away to meditate on it, and to bring back the result to him, when he had reached a definite understanding thereof. The well-known story of Indra Deva and the Devas and Asuras may serve as an illustration. Such exercise drew out the latent powers of the student, and may explain the profundity of thought of the great Teachers of the Past. They were not concerned with explaining a difficulty, but with stimulating the intellectual powers of their pupils, so that these themselves might overcome it. The modern fashion of pouring welldigested facts, with lucid explanations of their interrelationships, into the brains of the students tends to produce clever superficiality and success in the examination room, but does not conduce to original thinking and deep knowledge. (The hint may be worth considering in modern Universities.) Even after the forest was no longer used, Indian Universities were ever built in scenes of natural beauty, surrounded by lovely gardens, fragrant with blossoms and shady with trees, surrounded by a high wall, with guarded gates. The site of an insignificant village may sometimes be selected, because of its beauty. Thus Nagarjuna (Cir. 300) with his pupil Arya Deva is said to have visited a then insignificant village on a beautiful site south of Patalipura, and this led to the foundation of the great Vihara of Nalanda by Arya Deva, later in this fourth century of the Christian era. The influence of natural beauty on the development of the mind is little thought of now-a-days, when a Civic University is founded in Birmingham, in Leeds, in Machester.</p>
		<p>The number of students attached to an Ashrama or Vihara, in Ancient or Middle India sometimes surprises one. But in a forest there was plenty of room, and in﻿ the Vihara, the spaces were large; one courtyard in the University of Vikramasila accommodated 8,000 people. Kalidasa speaks of Kanva, the sage, as Kulapati, i.e., a sage who feeds and teaches 10,000 students. It may be well to remember that studious adults would long remain as pupils of a much-respected sage, giving their time to meditation and profound philosophical study, and also to helping the Guru with the younger pupils. In <em>The Modern Review </em>(August 1923, p. 216), there is a paragraph under the heading, "A University in the Shakuntala," noticing a paper in <em>To-morrow</em> by Mr. R.G. Kulkarni, who draws attention to this name of Kulapati, given to Kanva, and says:</p>
		<p><small>The original study of the Mahabharata gives a graphic description of Kanva's Ashram. It is plainly stated therein, that thousands of sages were seen in the Ashram by King Dushyanta, engaged in the study of different lores and sciences. It, therefore, clearly follows that the term Kulapati is not without its meaning in the play, and that the Ashram really consisted of not less than ten thousand students coming from different parts of the country.</small></p>
		<p><small>It would be extremely entertaining to the imagination to try to depict a mental picture of an educational institution that consisted of ten thousand students, all bright, pure, inspiring faces, living together, learning together. Even such a big number in an educational institution was not a novelty in Ancient India.</small></p>
		<p>It may also be remembered that the periods for the full study of the three Vedas were very long, and that the method of teaching alluded to above made little﻿ inroad on the time of the Kulapati. It is stated that the number of pupils to be taught by one professor was limited to five hundred in some universities. Again, much time was devoted to learning by heart. A student took up one or more branches of study, as a Brahmana would take up one, two, or three Vedas, and he had to commit to memory the whole book, or books, which he studied. You will remember the astonishing feat of Pandit Vasudeva Sarvabhauma, the head of the Nadiya University; the University of Mithila was the only happy possessor of a text-book of Nyaya, and refused to allow it to be copied for the benefit of another university. So the great Pandit went as a student to Mithila, learned the whole testbook by heart, and returning to his own University, he set up a first-rate College for the study of Nyaya instead of the unsatisfactory one existing until then.</p>
		<p>It may also be remembered how Suta was begged to visit the great gathering of those who sought his learning in the Naimisharanya, and, how many of the Vaidic treatises bear the affix, showing that they were studied in forests.</p>
		<p>Among the Homes of Learning in Ancient India, the Sangams of the South demand notice. The Sangam is evidently the Sangha of Northern India; we find the word Sangharama applied to Buddhist monasteries, all of which were practically either schools, colleges or universities. Hiouen-Tsang mentions that there were one hundred Sangharamas in Kashmir with five thousand monks. The Buddhist monks were both teachers and students, and this﻿ seems to have been usual in Buddhist Viharas everywhere; in Burma, elementary education is still given in the monasteries. The boy for the time is a Bhikshu.. The residence for long periods in Monasteries and Sangams was due to the deep desire for knowledge which is ingrained in the Indian temperament, and also to the high honour paid to learning. I have already referred to the interesting article in <em>The Calcutta Review</em> of January 1922 by Professor S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar who is so high an authority on Tamil Land. He rightly says that "if at times we come upon references which lead us to the inference that learning, as such, was held in extraordinarily high veneration, the explanation is clearly to hand that that veneration was in proportion to the labour and single-minded devotion that it called for in its acquisition." Learning was sought for love of learning and not for collateral advantages such as making a livelihood.</p>
		<p>Dr. Aiyangar proceeds by summarizing the traditional account of the famous three Sangams of Madura, of which the first was said to have lasted for 16,149 years, the second 3,700, and the third 1,850. It is by no means impossible that the insititution lasted through the periods named, and that specially brilliant assemblages were regarded as marking a literary age. (I should add that Professor Aiyangar regarded the terms mentioned as "fabulously long", so he must not be credited with the above remark.) He comes to a view which appears to me to be correct and very important, as implying a high standard of critical culture and a wide extension of general education. He writes:﻿</p>
		<p><small>There are two features with regard to these assemblies that call for special remark. The first, the academies were standing bodies of the most eminent among the learned men of the time in all branches of knowledge. The next, it was the approval of this learned body as a whole that set the seal of authority on the works presented to it (p. 43).</small></p>
		<p>In fact, the Madura Sangam held in the Tamil Land a position closely resembling that held by the Academic Francaise in France. A French book which receives its imprimatar is accepted by the whole literary world. Similar assemblies, the learned professor says, existed in other parts of India, and they seem also to have exercised the function of examining bodies.</p>
		<p>Dr. Aiyangar, in a leamed work on the Southern India's contributions to Indian culture, remarks:</p>
		<p><small>The main source of information for the period previous to the rise of the Pallavas into importance is Tamil Literature, of which we have a body with a character all its own. This body of works is known among Tamil scholars by the collective designation, "Sangarn Works". This designation assumes the existence of a body, of an academy, of scholars and critics, whose imprimatur was necessary for the publication of any work of literature in Tamil. The Tamil world "Sangam” is the Sanskrit "Sangha" and means ordinarily no more than an assembly. In this particular application, however, it means a body of scholars of recognized worth and standing in the world of letters, who were maintained by the contemporary kings and constituted themselves a board before whom every work seeking recognition had to be read. It is only when this body as a whole signified its approval that the work could go forth﻿ into the world as a Sangam work. It does not, however, mean that other works were not written and published. There are some which have come down to us, which do not appear to have gone before the Sangam. The function of this body seems, therefore, to be merely to set up a standard of excellence for works which aspire to the dignity of Sangam works. </small><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-06">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>The Rishi Agastya is said to have been a member of the first and second Sangams, and to have written the authoritative grammar of the Age, the Agattiyam.</p>
		<p>In a work entitled Tamil Studies, by M. Srinivasa Aiyangar, M.A., (1914)-- an interesting and useful work, summarizing the early history of Tamil culture and civilization from original sources--the author frankly says that the "topics have been treated from the standpoint of modern criticism, traditions and legends being discarded or utilized with great caution." Archaeological researches have verified so many "traditions and legends" discarded in the boyish days of western science, that later writers treat them with more and more respect, though with suspended judgement, until they are duly verified by some bones or stones. Mr. M.S. Aiyangar thinks that the Rishi Agastya's date cannot be earlier than the 5th or 6th century B.C. (loc. cit. p. 238), Yet <em>The Manual of the Administration of Madras Presidency </em>puts the meeting of Shri Ramachandra with the Rishi Agastya at 2000 B.C., and mentions His great influence over an early Pandyan king, Kulashekara. Obviously the "date" of a Rishi cannot be fixed; the most that is possible would be the finding of a date, or dates, at which He temporarily appeared in our physical history,</p>
		<p>Mr. Aiyangar has the following on the coming of the Rishi from the North:</p>
		<p><small>The life of Agastya is clothed in myth; but this much is certain that he was a Brahman of North India and that he led the first colony of Brahmans which settled in the Tamil Districts. According to another tradition, he was a member of the Sanskrit Academy at Benares which was presided over by Vyasa, the compiler of the Vedas, and, after quarrelling with his colleagues there, he wended his way down to the Tamil country and established the first Tamil Academy at Madura. It is said that the Tamil language is indebted to him for its grammar. He was the first to introduce the worship of Siva and the science of medicine among the South Indian Dravidians. Though most of the Tamil works now existing on chemistry, physiology and medicine, which are commonly attributed to him, are pure forgeries, he might have been acquainted with the art of medicine and the first Rishi to teach it to the Tamil Nation.</small><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-07">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>As to the 5th or 6th century B.C., the learned author must surely be aware that the date of King Solomon at the building of the Temple was, according to the canonical version of the Anglican Bible, B.C. 1014 to 1005. It is clear that King Hiram of Tyre traded with Tamil Land, because Tamil names are given, in the Hebrew Bible, to some of the things he bought. According to Dr. Sayce's statement in The Hibbert Lectures of 1887, there was trade between India and Babylon in 3000 B.C., so that The Madras Manual is far too late in putting the meeting of Shri Ramachandra and the Rishi at B.C. 2000.</p>
		<p>A curious sidelight is thrown by Rao Saheb R. Krishna Rao Bhonsle, Joint Secretary of the South Indian Research Committee, which publishes a useful magazine. He tells a story from an ancient Tamil classic, showing that some system of shorthand must have been used by reporters at the Third Madura Tamil Sangam, A.D. 108. All those who sought its imprimatur had to read their work before them. Moved by some undersirable feeling, they arranged to have reporters concealed in the hall, where a poet was to recite his poem, and would claim certificate from them. The reporters took down the poem verbatim, and when the time came for decision they said that the poem was not original and produced their verbatim copy. The fraud was exposed by a Poet-Saint Idaikadar who went to the Sangam with the Poet Tiruvalluvar, author of the Kural, and his sister, the Poetess Anvai. The Poet-Saint introduced into his poem words imitating the cries of birds and beasts. The reporters could not take them down, and the fraud was exposed. The poem still exists, and is entitled Oosimurri, oosi meaning stylus and murri breaking breaking the reporter's stylus! The Tamil word for a phonographer is oli (sound); yelluthu (letter), alan (writer), but the reporters had no signs for the animal cries.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-08">*</a></sup> Let us hope for the credit of the Sangam that this story is a libel; the <em>Oosi-murri</em> may have been a mere jue d'esprit. The mere fact of its existence no more proves that the Sangam acted dishonourably than the picking up of a piece of wood on the top of Mount Ararat proved, as the finder thought, that the Ark of Noah had come to an anchorage there, as the flood subsided.</p>
		<p>The point that strikes one with amazement-amazement because of the entire ignorance about it in the West, except among scholars is the astounding spread of literary and scientific learning in India from an unknown antiquity down to the middle of the eighteenth century. If possible, this wonder is increased when we turn to the famous University in the North on which we hear so many eulogies and of which we know so little, Takshashila, or Takkashila, Grecised into Taxila, that perished from 450 to 500 A.D., Taxila, whose bones have been unburied in the present century.</p>
		<p>When we go northward and seek to find particulars of the famous Takshashila, we are sorely disappointed. We are told that "the remains of Taxila" are twenty miles north-west of the present Rawalpindi; that the valley is "a singularly pleasent one, well-watered by the rivers Hard and its tributaries, and protected by a girdle of hills"; that it was a very important city in "early times", being on the great trade route which used to connect Hindustan with Central and Western Asia; that in the days of Alexander it was a great and flourishing city; that the country was﻿ "thickly populated and extremely fertile". Nearly a thousand years afterwards Hiouen-Tsang found it still fertile with rich harvests, flowing streams and luxuriant vegetation. But the great University had gone. It is mentioned in the Mahabharata, in connection with King Janamejaya, who had conquered it, and his snake-sacrifice; it became part of the Persian Empire (521-485 B.C.), and between that and about A.D. 510, was occupied in turn by six more nations. "That Taxila at this time and during the centuries immediately following enjoyed a great reputation as a University town, famous for the arts and sciences of the day, is evident from numerous passages in the Buddhist Jatakas; but apart from this fact nothing is known of its history prior to the invasion of Alexander the Great." That is B.C. 326, when Ambhi is King of the town and makes submission to him. "The city was then very wealthy, populous and well-governed, and (that) its territories extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes." Appollonius of Tyana probably visited Taxila, for some of the details are corroborated by the excavations lately made. In 400 A.D. Fa-Hien visited the town, but says nothing about it, but his accounts of other places in that part of the world show that "the great Buddhist sanctuaries of the north-west were still relatively vigorous and flourishing." But the excavations have shown that</p>
		<p><small>the monuments of Taxila were wantonly and ruthlessly devastated in the course of the same century. This work of destruction is almost certainly to be attributed to the hordes of barbarian White Huns who,﻿after the year 455 A.D., swept down into India in ever-increasing numbers, carrying sword and fire wherever they went, and not only possessed themselves of the kingdom of the Kinshans, but eventually overthrew the great Empire of the Guptas. From this calamity Taxila never again recovered.</small></p>
		<p>Such is the interesting account of Sir John Marshall, Director-General of Archaeology in India. To his patient and persevering labours during four years, we owe the knowledge of the dead Taxila. His valuable Guide to Taxila, published in 1921, gives us the skeleton of the wonderful body, once pulsing and thrilling with splendid intellectual life, life so strong and vivid that even its tradition still inspires those who would fain see in every great Indian State a University, which would do for the future what Taxila, Nalanda and Vikramasila did in the past. And why not, since the descendants of some of the kings who founded them are still here?</p>
		<p>Let us see, however hastily, what may be learned from the <em>Jatakas.</em></p>
		<p>In'a very interesting article by Professor Radhakumud Mookerji on "Indian Education from the <em>Jatakas",</em> he gives a very useful extract from Jataka No. 252, showing how Princes went to Taxila:</p>
		<p>Once upon a time, Brahmadatta, the King of Benares, had a son named Prince Brahmadatta.. Now kings of former times, though there might be a famous teacher living in their own city, often used to send their sons to foreign countries afar off to complete their education, that by this means they might learn to quell their pride and high﻿ mindedness, and endure heat or cold, and be raade acquainted with the ways of the world. So did this King. Calling his boy to him now the lad was sixteen years old--he gave him one-soled sandals, a sunshade of leaves and a thousand pieces of money, with these words: "My son, get you to Takkasila, and study there."</p>
		<p>The boy obeyed. He bade his parents farewell, and in due course arrived at Takkasila. There he enquired for the teacher's dwelling, and reached it at the time when the teacher had finished his lecture and was walking up and down at the door of the house. When the lad set .eyes upon the teacher, he loosed his shoes, closed his sunshade, and, with a respectful greeting, stood still where he was. The teacher saw that he was weary, and welcomed the new comer. The lad ate and rested a little. Then he returned to the teacher, and stood respectfully by him:</p>
		<p class="verse">"Where have you come from?" he asked. </p>
		<p class="verse">"From Benares." </p>
		<p class="verse">'Whose son are you?" </p>
		<p class="verse">"I am the son of the King of Benares."</p>
		<p class="verse">"What brings you here?"</p> 
		<p class="verse">"I come to learn," replied the lad.</p>
		<p class="verse">"Well, have you brought a teacher's fee, or do you wish to attend on me in return for teaching you?"</p> 
		<p class="verse">"I have brought a fee with me," and with this he laid at the teacher's feet his purse of a thousand pieces.</p>
		<p>The resident pupils attend on their teacher by day and at night they learn of him; but they who bring a fee are treated like the eldest sons in his house, and thus they learn. And this teacher, like the rest, gave schooling to the Prince on every light and lucky day. Thus the young Prince was taught.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-09">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>The learned Professor points out that "this extract introduces us practically to all the principal features of the education of the time." To go to Taxila is "to complete their education." The appropriate age for the University was sixteen: "The Prince of Benares is, as we have seen, sent to Takkasila for his studies with the modest equipment given him by his own royal father of "a pair of onesoled sandals, a sunshade of leaves and a thousand pieces of money' as his teacher's fees, of which not a single piece could he retain for his private use. Thus the Prince enters his school as a poor man, divested of all riches." A very good thing for him, and likely, as the Jataka says of Princes, "to quell their pride and high-mindedness. Taxila seems to have held the place in Ancient India that Nalanda held in Middle Age India. The Professor says:</p>
		<p>The fame of Takkasila (Taxila) as a seat of learning was, of course, due to that of its teachers. They are always spoken of as being "world-renowned," being authorities, specialists and experts in the subjects they professed. And it was the presence of scholars of such acknowledged excellence and widespread reputation that caused a steady movement of qualified students drawn from all classes and ranks of society towards Taxila from different and distant parts of the Indian Continent, making it the intellectual capital of the India of these days. Thus the various centres of learning in the different parts of the country became affiliated, as it were, to the educational centre or the central University of Taxila which exercised a kind of intellectual suzerainty over the wide world of letters in India (p. 228).</p>
		<p>A good general idea of the education given may be gathered from casual references in the Jatakas which, as the Editor, Professor E.B. Cowell says, are "full of interest as giving a vivid picture of the social life and customs of Ancient India. . . They form in fact an ever-shifting panorama of the village life such as Fa-Hien and HiouenTsang saw it in the old days before the Muhammadan Conquest, when Hindu institutions and native rule prevailed in every Province throughout the land.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-10">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>There are no less than 105 references to Taxila in these tales, shoving how it was recognized as the centre of high education; the sons of kings, princes and nobles were sent there, and paid fees; the sons of the poor also went there and paid by services, or by promises to pay later when they beg for their fees.</p>
		<p>500 young Brahmanas studied under one teacher (No. 97). This number is several times mentioned and was evidently the number of students placed under the charge of a single teacher. The students gathered firewood(No. 71). The journey thither, 2,000 leagues from Benares, was dangerous while passing through a great forest, inhabited by ogresses, but the safe journey round the forest was twice as long as passing through it (No. 96). A pupil is beaten for stealing sweets (No. 252). Youths of the Kshatriya and Brahmana castes "came from all India to be taught the Arts" from a "world-renowned teacher;" the three Vedas were also taught by him (No. 353). A world-famed teacher preached the moral law to any one that he might see. .... But though they received it they kept it not (No. 356). A young Brahmana of Benares, having acquired all the liberal Arts at Takkasila, and having attained to proficiency in archery, etc., (No. 374). The Arts taught at Takkasila included magic spells (No. 416). As soon as a lad of Benares "came of age", his father gave him a thousand pieces and sent him to study at Takkasila; thither he went, and studied with an world-famed teacher, and became the chief pupil in a company of 500 youths; while the teacher was absent, the pupils were put in this lad's charge; when the teacher returned, he taught the lad "all branches of skill and learning" and "dismissed him with a great troop of followers" (No. 447). "Skill". is evidently the Arts- shilpa. Prince Junha of Benares studying at Takkasila, accidentally knocked down a man and broke his bowl. He picked up the man who asked the price of a meal as his bowl was broken. The Prince answered that he could not then give it, but when he became king in Kashi, the man could come and ask for it (No. 456). Students were penniless as mentioned on p. 175. Outcastes were not admitted to the Academy, but two young Chandalas, having suffered from their birth, disguised themselves as Brahmanas and went to Takkasila where they studied law; they went with others, invited to a meal (rice porridge), and were discovered, beaten and driven out (No. 498).</p>
		<p>Mr. Bimala Charan Law, in his Historical Gleanings, has a short essay on "Taxila as a Seat of Learning in Sanskrit and Pali Literature." He mentions that the King of Kosala and Jivaka, "the renowned physician," were students there, the first generally for education and the second for medicine and surgery. The three Vedas were taught, but the Atharva is never mentioned in the Pali Jatakas. He thinks the word sippa (shikpa) is used in "the comprehensive sense of learning;" but surely it is better taken in its usual meaning of Arts as the eighteen Viñas would cover the branches of learning, and Arts are needed to include the use of the bow, the javelin, the finding of hidden treasure, magic charms, etc. Professor Radhakumud takes the word as Arts, and considers that it covers scientific and technical education. The latter also mentions military, medical and law schools.</p>
		<p>The last great centre of Hindu learning that I have time to mention is Nadiya. The town of Navadwipa or Nadiya, a town about 70 miles north of Calcutta on the banks of the Bhagirathi, was built in 1063, and the College appears to have been founded about the same time. The town was taken in the Muslim invasion of 1203, but neither town nor Colleges suffered. It was a great centre of Sanskrit learning, the course of study including the Vedas, Vedangas, the six Darshanas, the Purva and Uttara Mimamsas, Yoga and Logic,</p>
		<p>Mr. Shishir Kumar Ghose, in his work, Lord Gouranga, writes:﻿</p>
		<p>The one absorbing idea of all the respectable citizens was the acquisition of knowledge. The old and the young, men and women, among the higher classes, were constantly engaged in intellectual pursuits, as if there was no other business in the world. Wealth, politics, war, pleasures and amusements had no attraction for them. Fighting they abhorred as being the occupation of beasts of prey and unworthy of human beings. Gratification of the senses, they knew, debased the soul, and they had such an aversion for sensual pleasures that no liquor shop was permitted to be established in the city. It was considered disgraceful to hold office, even that of the Prime Minister of the King, an office holder being likened to a dog.</p>
		<p>In the opinion of the citizens, man was born only to acquire knowledge, which was the end and aim of human life. The student was the only being who could claim the title of man.</p>
		<p>The intense devotion to learning, by the majority of the citizens of Navadwipa, gave a peculiar character to the town, distinguishing it from any other city in the world. Students thronged everywhere. They filled the market-place, the streets, the bathing-ghats and the strand. They assembled in thousands at every convenient spot to hold literary discussions. When the students walked in the street they talked on literary subjects. Literary tournaments were held every day at every ghat of the city. And so earnest were the combatants that sometimes these tournaments ended in free fights, and the defeated parties had to swim across to the other bank of the river to save themselves. Each student held a book in his left hand that being his distinguishing badge to mark him out from others. It was his ornament, his friend and his strength, which secured for him respectful attention everywhere.﻿</p>
		<p>In each street there were several Toles (Colleges); and each College contained, according to The Chitanya Bhagabat, hundreds and, sometimes, thousands of students. Says Thakur Brindaban, himself a citizen, a saint, a student, and an eye-witness: "Thousands every day came to the city from all parts of India, some to begin and some to finish their education, and thousands left every days after having obtained their diplomas."</p>
		<p>This account reminds one of the description given of Alexandria in the days of the great controversy over the internal relations of the persons in the Christian Trinity. It was said that the controversy raged so widely that if you went into a shop to buy a piece of cloth, the shopman tried to discuss with you these relations instead of supplying you with his goods.</p>
		<p>It will be noticed from the dates that Hindu and Buddhist schools taught side by side, and that the "Ages" are named with regard to the most famous seminaries of the time. So also in passing to the Mussalman Period, the older educational institutions continued, except for temporary destructions, in which Buddhism suffered most from the Huns, and some were entirely blotted out.</p>
		<p>In the villages, especially in the South, the little schools continued, as we shall see later, but these perishedsave for a few feeble survivals even down to our own timer with the destruction of the village governments in 1816.</p>
		<p>A wonderful feat of memory is told, which gave it the one college it lacked, one for the proper teaching of Nyaya. There was no available text-book; Nyaya was taught at Mithila, but the Bengali students were not allowed to make a copy of the text-book. So Vasudeva Sarvabhauma went to Mithila to study Nyaya, and committed the whole text-book to memory. He then returned home and opened a college for Nyaya.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-11">*</a></sup> At that time the college contained a youth of wonderful intellect, Nimai by name. He was destined to become the glory of Nadiya, has been called the Avatara of Nadiya, known later as Chaitanya, or the Lord Gouranga. It is interesting to read that as late as in the year 1867, Professor Cowell visited this ancient College; he writes:</p>
		<p>I could not help looking at these unpretending lecture halls with a deep interest, as I thought of the pandits lecturing there to generation after generation of eager, inquisitive minds. Seated on the floor with his "corona" of listening pupils round him, the teacher expatiates on those refinements of infinitesimal logic which make a European's brain dizzy to think of, but whose labyrinth e trained Nadiya student will thread with unfaltering precision. I noticed during my visit middleaged and even grey-haired men among the students.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-12">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>As late as 1908, Mr. Ward found there 30 Toles and 250 pupils. Each school taught a single subject.</p>
		<p>In closing this review of the Hindu Age, I may and that, with regard to both Hindu and Buddhist, it is the spirit which I would see revived, the attitude to life, not every detail of the outer rules: The veneration for learning, the taking it as a vocation, the simple life of the student, the loyalty to duty, the recognition of dharma. This, adapted to modern life, should be the ideal.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Buddhist Age</strong><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-13">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>Coming to the Buddhist Period, Nalanda University at once springs up before our eyes, Nalanda, visited by the three famous Chinese travellers, Fa-Hien, travelling in India from 399 to 414 A.D.; Hiouen-Tsang, from 629 to 645 A.D.; I-Tsing from 673 to 693 A.D., who lived in the monastery for ten years and gives a minute account of Buddhist observances in<em> A Record of the Buddhist Religion as practised in India,</em> etc., A.D. 671-695 (the dates of his leaving and his return to China) by I-Tsing, translated by J. Takakusu, B.A., Ph.D., 1896.</p>
		<p>Nalanda was situated on the bank of Ganga, to the south-east of Patalipura (now Patna), built by Ajatashatru, and north of Rajagriha, his older capital of Magadha: FaHien visited it in the 5th century before it was completed by King Baladitya, about the middle of the same century, the three kings before him having laboured at it successively, after it had been founded by Arya Deva on the spot chosen by his Guru, Nagarjuna, as noted on p. 163. Its architecture was splendid, 'its gardens beautiful. J. Talbhoys Wheeler says (quoted in an article on Nalanda by Rao Saheb Krishna Rao Bhonsle, in South Indian Research, pp. 55 to 57, January 1922):</p>
		<p><small>The huge monastery was a vast University. Towers, domes and pavilions stood amidst a paradise of trees, gardens and fountains. ... Ten thousand Buddhist monks and novices were lodged and supplied with every necesity. All the inmates were lodged, boarded, taught and supplied with vestments without charge. They studied the sacred books of all religions. In like manner, they studied all the sciences, especially arithmetic and medicine.</small></p>
		<p>This is confirmed by Hiouen-Tsang, in the translation by. Stanilaus Julien, quoted in the same article:</p>
		<p><small>The richly adorned towers were arranged in regular ordur, the pavilions decorated with coral appeared like pointed hill tops; the soaring domes reached to the clouds, and the pinnacles of the temples seemed to be lost in the mist of the morning. From the windows one could see the movements of the winds and clouds, and above their lofty roofs the sun and moon could be seen in conjunction. All around, pools of translucent water shone with the pearls of the blue lotus flowers; here and there the lovely kanaka trees hung between them. In the different courts, the houses of the monks were each four storeys in height. The pavilions had pillars ornamented with jade and richiy chiselled, and balustrades of carved open work. The lintels of the doors were decorated with elegance, and the roofs covered with glazed tiles of brilliant colours, which multiplied themselves by reflection, and varied the effect at every moment in a thousand manners (p. 55).</small></p>
		<p>Later kings'erected Viharas outside its surrounding wall, through which only one gate gave admission. This gate was guarded by a Dvara Pandita, who asked the﻿ would-be student some difficult question, and he had to take himself off if he could not answer. In fact, it was what would now be called a Post-Graduate University. Within were six great ranges of buildings each four storeys high. The one which contained the library, said to be the largest in India, had nine storeys. It had one hundred lecture rooms. He mentions in his travels many other Viharas, where "resident priests, having chambers, have their beds, mats, food, drink, and clothes provided without stint; in all cases, this is the same."<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-14">*</a></sup> In those days and later it had some 10,000 monks. It was in the fullest sense of the word a University where all religions and sciences were studied, especially arithmetic and medicine. Dr. Macdonnell, quoted by Rao Saheb R. Krishna Rao Bhonsle, says that in some subjects, "as Science, Phonetics, Grammer, Mathematics, Anatomy, Medicine and Law, attainment of Indians was far in advance of what was achieved by the Greeks." Little wonder that students travelled to Nalanda from Europe, as from all parts of Asia. There was no attempt to discourage the study of the eighteen Buddhist schools, while the Vedas also were taught and discussed, as said by Mr. R.C. Dutt:</p>
		<p>Buddhism had never assumed a hostile attitude towards the parent religion of India; and the fact that the two religions existed side by side for long centuries increased their toleration of each other. In every country, Buddhists and orthodox Hindus lived side by side. Hindus went to Buddhist monasteries and universities, and Buddhists learned from Brahmana sages. The same kings favoured the followers of both systems of religion. The Gupta Emperors were often worshipers of Siva and Vishnu, but loaded Buddhists and Buddhist monasteries with gifts, presents and favours. One king was often a Buddhist and his son an orthodox Hindu; and often two brothers followed or favoured the two religions without fighting. Every Court had learned men belonging to both the religions, and Vikramaditya's Court' was no exception to the rule.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-15">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>Mr. Dutt, in the book above quoted (p. 148), summarises the account given by Hiouen-Tsand of Nalanda as a seat of learning:</p>
		<p>Our traveller now came to the great Nalanda University, if we may call it by that name. The monks of this place, to the number of several thousands, were men of the highest ability, talent and distinction. "The countries of India respect them and follow them. The day is not sufficient for asking and answering profound questions. From morning till night they engage in discussion; the old and the young mutually help one another. Those who cannot discuss questions out of the Tripitaka. are little esteemed, and are obliged to hide themselves for shame. Learned men from different cities, on this account, who desire to acquire quickly a renown in discussion, come here in multitudes to settle their doubts, and then the streams (of their wisdom) spread far and wide. For this reason some persons usurp the name (of Nalanda students) and in going to and fro receive honour in consequence."</p>
		<p>Dr. Fergusson justly remarks that what Cluny and Clairvaux were to France in the Middle Ages, Nalanda was to Central India, the depository of true learning, the centre from which it spread over to other lands.</p>
		<p>It is noted above that medicine was much studied, and Mr. Dutt remarks that</p>
		<p><small>medicine appears to have made great progress in the Buddhist Age, when hospitals were established all over the country. The great writers on Hindu medicine, Charaka and Sushruta, lived and wrote in the Buddhist Age, but their works seem to have been recast in the Puranic Age (p. 123). But it was in astronomy that the most brilliant results were achieved in the Buddhist Age. We have seen before that astronomical observations were made as early as the Vaidic Age; and that early in the Epic Age the lunar zodiac was fixed, the position of the solstitial points marked, and other phenomena carefully observed and noted (p."119).</small></p>
		<p>At Nalanda, the five great Siddhantas were studied, and its curriculum included Logic, Grammer, Philosophy and Metaphysics, History, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Sanskrit, Pali, Music and Tantrik Medicine. I mention this last, because I am inclined to think that the interest taken in the Tantras put a close to its splendid existence. No one can read I-Tsing's laborious and minute work without recognizing that little attention was paid to the Lord Buddha's perfect Ethics and his superb Philosophy. I-Tsing's account is all about minute and mostly unimportant sittings, and walkings, and gestures. There is no life, no inspiration. At his time, there were only 8,000 monks there, and the great University was growing weak. Its place was taken by the "Royal University of Vikramasila," founded by King Dharmapala of Gauda in the 8th century A.D. He gave it four groups of 27 monks, each group belonging to a separate sect. Its high wall had six gates, and each opened the way to a College, if the applicant could pass the Dvara Pandita who protected the gate and was the head of the College. An interesting article on the University appears in the Vishva-Bharati Quarterly of April, 1924, from the pen of Professor J.N. Samaddar. Mr... Phanindranath Bose says, on the authority of Lama Taranatha, it stood on a precipitous hill in Magadha on the bank of Ganga, in what is now known as the District of Bhagalpur. The University flourished for four centuries, and was destroyed with those of Nalanda and Odantapuri, of which last little is known; it had 1,000 monks and it is said that many students came to it from all parts of India. These three Universities perished in the Muslim invasion of 1199, and Mr. Samaddar remarks, in the article above quoted (p. 62), that by the destruction of these three Buddhist seats of learing, "Buddhism received a blow from which it has never been able to recover." And the monastery of Jagaddala, founded by King Ramapala, King of Bengal and Magadha, 1084 to 1130, in his new capital, Ramavati, at the beginning of the twelfth century in Northern Bengal, became a centre of culture in Bengal, but only lived for a century, wiped﻿</p>
		<p>out by the Muslim invasion in 1203. Then also perished the University of Kartaya. Tolerance is shown in the various Universities; in Tamralipli, at the mouth of the Hugli, there were twenty-two Viharas and hostels for students, and these were filled by Brahmanas and Buddhists.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Muhammadan Age</strong></p>
		<p>When we turn from the Hindu and Buddhist Temples of Learning to the Muhammadan work for and influence on Education in India, we must remember the splendid record of Islam in Arabia, its birthplace, its great University at Baghdad-destroyed by the same White Huns who devastated Taxila- the University that created Moorish Learning, and sent the torch of Science in the hands of the Moors to Spain. The Huns were enemies of all learning and of all culture, and almost succeeded in murdering the young civilization of Europe, slowly rising since the decay of Greece and the fall of the Roman Empire. It is well known that the great Prophet of Arabia set the ink of the scholar above the blood of the martyr, and that Ali, his beloved son-in-law, was the strong patron of learning.</p>
		<p>The early raids from the North, which devastated, were succeeded by invaders who came to stay and who used discretion in their destruction. Even the fierce raider, Mahmud of Ghazni (A.D. 1000-26), fostered education in his own country, but he was a fanátical hater of images, and much of his destruction of schools was probably due﻿ to the fact that they were usually attached to temples. [The great authority on Muslim Education in India is Narendranath Law, whose <em>Promotion of Learning in India during Muhammadan Rule (by Muhammadans)</em> is a splendid monograph, and may be taken as authoritative. For his learning, the fact that he was a Premchand Roychand Scholar may be taken as a guarantee. It was published in 1916.) It is customary for every Masjid to have in an elementary school attached to it, the Maktab, but the Muslim College is the Madrasah. Suitan Mahmud had a University in Ghazni, with a fine library and museum, and it was rendered famous by the presence of the poet Firdausi, and his Court was crowded with learned men. But he was only known in India as a raider of great ferocity. Muhammad, Ghori, of the House which overthrew that of Ghazni, was the first to settle in Delhi (1192), and it became a resort of learned men. It was his lieutenant who destroyed Vikramasila, leaving not a single scholar alive" (p.20), and other great seats of learning shared its fate. His name, Bakhtiyar Khilji, remains for ever infamous. A Sultana Raziyah was a patron of learning, following the example of her father Altamash, who built a Muslim College at Delhi between 1210 and 1236. Amid changes of dynasties and wars, learned men shone out from time to time, like Sultan Firuz (1351-1388), a scholar himself and a patron of learning. He brought two Ashoka Pillars to Delhi instead of destroying them-a mark of grace, shewing a welcome taste for Art. He says of himself:</p>
		<p><small>Among the gifts which God has bestowed upon me, His humble servant, was a desire to erect publič buildings. So I built many Masjids, Colleges and Monasteries that the learned, and the elders, the devout and the holy, might worship God in these edifices and aid the kind builder by their prayers. The digging of canals, the planting of trees and the endowing with lands are in accordance with the directions of the Law (p. 57).</small></p>
		<p>He also repaired buildings that had fallen into decay like the Jami Masjid of old Delhi. He built at Firuzabad the Firuz-Shahi Madrasah of which Mr. N. Law writes:</p>
		<p><small>The Madrasah was a very commodious building embellished with lofty domes and situated in an extensive garden adorned with alleys and avenues, and all that human art combined with nature could contribute to make the place fit for meditation. An adjacent tank mirrored in its shiny and placid breast the high and massive house of study standing on its brink. What a charming sight was it when the Madrasah hummed with hundreds of busy students, walking its clean and smooth floors, diverting themselves on the side of the tank, or listening in attentive masses to the learned lectures of the professors from their respective seats!</small></p>
		<p><small>Of the learned men to whom the responsible task of educating the young alumni of the college was entrusted, we hear only of two. There was Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi, the renowned master of many subjects who used to lecture on Theology, explain to the students the Fiqh (Jurisprudence) and the commentaries' on the Quran and teach them the time-honoured traditions. The other professor was a great religious teacher and had hailed from Samarkhand.﻿</small></p>
		<p><small>Both the students and the professors had to reside within the College, and so there were the facilities that a constant communion among the students themselves as well as between the tutors and the taught could afford. The College was not, as can already be anticipated, a place for exclusively secular studies only, but in it was also carefully looked after the spiritual well-being of the students. There was a big Masjid attached thereto in which the five compulsory as well as extra prayers were regularly said, the former being performed in gatherings conducted by the Sufis, who at other times remained engaged in counting beads and praying for the well-being of the Sultan. The Hafizes (those who learn by heart the Quran) had to recite the whole Quran and pray for the Emperor and all Mussalmans.</small></p>
		<p><small>There were separate apartments in the College for the reception and accommodation of the travellers who, attracted by its reputation, paid it visits from distant countries.</small></p>
		<p><small>The College was also noted for bounty and charity to the poor and the needy, for in its Masjid they received the help they wanted.</small></p>
		<p><small>There was a suitable provision for the bestowal of stipends and scholarships upon the successful students, and over and above these, every inmate of the Madrasah, be he a student, professor or traveller lodging there, received a fixed daily allowance for his maintenance. All these expenses were defrayed out of the State endowments as well as, in this particular case, out of the sums of money that were set apart by the State for being given in charity to contribute to the well-being of the Emperor.</small></p>
		<p><small>Where is now this. Madrasah, the glory of its age, with which the Colleges of Delhi, though famous, could never, according to Barni, stand in rivalry? It is now burled, along with its beauty and grandeur,﻿ its students and professors, its Masjid and all, in the deep abyss of Time. (Loc. cit., pp. 60-63.)</small></p>
		<p>Another was the beautiful Qudam Sharif, of which we are given a most attractive picture. It was raised to the memory of his son. Among the greatest merits of this Sultan must be noted his avoidance of persecution. He appointed Hindus to important offices, restored to his kingdom a Hindu Raja he had conquered, and when a fine library of 1,300 books was found in a Hindu temple, he ordered that some learned Hindus should be sent there for translating a few books (pp. 64, 65).</p>
		<p>Sultan Sikandar (1488-1518) was another who attracted many learned men to his Court from Arabia, Persia and Bokhara, as well as from India (p. 77), and it is noted that in his reign Hindus began to study Persian (p. 75), and Professor Blockman is quoted who remarked that this study began in the 16th century and "that before another century had elapsed they had fully come up to the Muhammadans in point of literary acquirements (pp. 75, 76, Note). He also gives the following interesting note from Keene:</p>
		<p>The name Urdu is of Turkish origin and means literally "camp". But the Mughals of India restricted its use to the precincts of the Imperial camp so that Urdu-i-Mu'alla (high camp) came to be a synonym for new Delhi after Shah Jahan had made it his permanent capital. The classical languages of Arabia and Persia were exclusively devoted to uses of State and religion; the Hindus cherished their Sanskrit and Hindi for their own purposes of business or worship, while the Emperor and﻿ his Mughal courtiers kept their Turkish speech as a means of free intercourse in private life. Out of such elements was the rich and growing language of Hindustan formed, and it was yearly becoming more widely spreadKeene's Mughal Empire, Note, p. 76.</p>
		<p>Mr. Law notes that many small Muslim kingdoms sprang up all over India, each making its own contribution to the general progress of Islamic learning in the country (pp. 80-113). He mentions ten of these. A ruler of the Bahmani Kingdom, Mahmud Shah, was a great patron of leters, and founded a Madrasah in the Deccan in 1378 for the education of orphans, feeding and lodging them, and providing learned professors for their training. He also started many schools and endowed them amply. The famous poet, Hafiz, was invited to his Court, and started for it, but was beaten back by a storm. Another ruler, Firuz, not only went to lectures on botany, geometry and logic, but he sent ships annually to different countries to invite learned men to his Court. He also built an observatory. A minister of a later Sultan built at Bidar a College which became famous. Our writer quotes Meadows Taylor as saying:</p>
		<p>The noble College of Mahmud Gawan, in the city of Bidar, was perhaps the grandest completed work of the period. It consisted of a spacious square with arches all round it, of two storeys, divided into convenient rooms. The minarets at each corner of the front were upwards of 100 feet high, and also the front itself, covered with enamel tiles, on which were flowers on blue, yellow and red grounds and sentences 13﻿ of the Quran in large kufic letters, the effect of which was at once chaste and superb. (Note from Meadows Taylor, pp. 67, 68.)</p>
		<p>Bijapur- perhaps Vidyapur- had a College in Hindu times, and Mr. Law remarks:</p>
		<p>The college building, made of granite, is very extensive and the most venerable in Bijapur, consisting of an oblong, set out with rows. It is three-storeyed, and is still wonderfully perfect, though necessarily out of repair.</p>
		<p>With the disappearance of Hindu soveriegnty Bijapur did not cease to be a centre of learning. The Muhammadans took the place of the Hindus and kept up its literary reputation (p.92).</p>
		<p>A part of the royal Adi Shahi Library is still to be found at Bijapur in the Asari Mahal. Mr. Fergusson tells us:</p>
		<p>Some of its books are curious and interesting to any one acquainted with Arabic and Persian literature. All the most valuable manuscripts were, it is said, taken away by Aurangzib-in cart-loads, and what remain are literally only a remnant, but a precious one to the persons in charge of the building, who show them with a mournful pride and regret (p.94).</p>
		<p>The king of Ahmadnagar was fond of single-stick, it seems, so "all men, both high and low, began to copy the prince, and instead of Colleges, as is usual in Muhammadan cities, schools for single-sword and wrestling were established in all quarters of the city" (p.95).</p>
		<p>The fine Chaliar Minar and its Masjid in Haiderabad Government with the minarets containing rooms for professors and students "is one of the most splendid buildings in the city, and a brilliant specimen of Saracenic architecture."</p>
		<p>It was built by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, who founded many other colleges and schools, while there were primary schools in the houses of the masters (pp. 95, 96).</p>
		<p>Among these smaller kingdoms Jaunpur stood high and became "a great seat of learning under its famous king Ibrahim Sharqi and it is said that during his reign the Court far outshone that of Delhi, and was the resort of the learned men of the East" (p. 100). His daughterin-law built a Masjid, a College and a Monastery, giving stipends to professors and students. It had hundreds of Madrasahs and Masjids, stipends being given to teachers and students "that they might devote themselves to learning, in complete freedom from material needs and anxieties. Both literature and the arts were followed" (pp. 101-104). It is said that in so many of these kingdoms and in Bengal these Madrasahs have almost vanished, though it was Muhammadans who had the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> and part of the <em>Mahabharata</em> translated into Bengali (pp. 109, 110).</p>
		<p>Of the Mughals, Babar himself was very learned, but Mr. Law does not give any details of his aid to education. Humayun was fond of study and conversation, but apparently did not follow the great traditions of past Muslim Rulers.</p>
		<p>Akbar (1566 to 1605) was remarkable for his love of learning and his Ibadat Khana, with its four halls in Fatehpur Sikri where "Sufis, doctors, preachers, lawyers, Sunnis, Shias, Brahmanas, Jains, Buddhists, Charbakas, Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians and learned men of every belief" argued on "profound points of science, the curiosities﻿ of history, the wonders of nature" (pp. 144, 145). Many parts of the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, the Atharva Veda, the Lilavati and many other books were translated into Persian. Akbar collected books assiduously, and Faizi's library of 4,600 volumes passed to the Emperor on his death. He introduced an improved system of education, and Hindus and Mussalmans studied in the same schools. Mr. Law says:</p>
		<p><small>The sciences were taught in the following order: morality, arithmetic, accounts, agriculture, geometry, longimetry, astronomy, geomancy, economics, the art of government, physics, logic, natural philosophy, abstract mathematics, divinity and history (pp. 161, 162).</small></p>
		<p>Great men and nobles. also did much for education. Jehangir kept up the traditions of his father, repairing Madrasahs which had fallen into disuse. Agra, which had become a seat of learning during Akbar's reign, continued to attract both professors and craftsmen, and the progress in Arts and Crafts was remarkable-music, painting as well as architecture lent beauty to life. Shah Jahan was more devoted to the last splendid Art than to education in general. But he founded an Imperial College to the south of the Jami Masjid; it had fallen into ruins before the Sepoy War, and was levelled with the ground soon afterwards (p.181). It is startling to find Bernier speaking of the "profound ignorance" in Hindustan, and asking "how is it possible there should be academies and colleges?" (p. 1807) and so on. Strange, what profound ignorance a European traveller could show of the deeper side of a country new to him.﻿</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Impact of Europe</strong></p>
		<p>When the East India Company made its way in its early days, it did not trouble itself about education, except so far as it needed clerks and accountants. These it obtained from the village schools, for although these did not make much mark in history except by the prosperity they ensured to the country, their disappearance meant the descent of the night of ignorance over the land. In the huge number of inscriptions collected by the Madras Government we find many lists of village officials and servants. Among these the village schoolmaster-or the temple priest acting as schoolmaster in small villages-appears. Mr. John Mathai writes:</p>
		<p><small>It is obvious that when the British took possession of the country, in the different Provinces they found that, though in most parts of the country except Western and Central India, there existed a widespread system of National Education, so far as they could trace, the position of the schoolmaster had in many cases changed from that of a village servant with a defined position in the community into that of a casual worker honoured in the village by reason of his sacred calling, but not sufficiently identified with the village to hold his ancient place on the village staff. This statement is true in the main, but nevertheless there were various traces left which pointed to the original connection of the schoolmaster with the village economy.</small><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-16">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>In the evidence given before the two Houses of Parliament in March and April 1813, Sir Thomas Munro mentioned, as one of the reasons why England might gain in her contact with India, was "schools established in every village for teaching, reading, writing and arithmetic."<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-17">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>In a despatch from the Court of Directors of the East India Company, dated June 3, 1814, the following passage occurs, referring to village communities and their schools:</p>
		<p><small>This venerable and benevolent institution of the Hindus is represented to have withstood the shock of revolutions, and to its operation is ascribed the general intelligence of the natives as scribes and accountants. We are so strongly persuaded of its great utility that we are desirous you should take early measures to inform yourselves of its present state and that you will report to us the result of your enquiries, affording in the meantime the protection of Government to the village teachers in all their just rights and immunities, and marking, by some favourable distinction, any individual amongst them who may be recommended by superior merit or acquirements; for, humble as their situation may appear, if judged by a comparison with any corresponding character in this country, we understand those village teachers are held in great veneration throughout India.</small><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-18">*</a></sup></p>
		<p>The destruction of the village system in 1816 in Madras, left the schools uncared for; the imposition of rent on cultivators who had had their share in the land of the village commnity, made them poorer, and the schoolmaster, no longer provided for, disappeared. These "pial schools" are still occasionally to be met with. In Adam's Reports in which appear the results of an enquiry in the Bengal Presidency, 1835-1838, Mr. Adams took typical Districts, not the whole Presidency, and found, in addition to the Toles and Madrasahs, Pathashalas and Maktabs. The first were found in "all the larger villages as in the towns. . . The age of the scholars was from about five or six to sixteen. The curriculum included reading, writing, the composition of letters, and elementary arithmetic and accounts, either commercial, or agricultural or both."<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-19">*</a></sup> Mr. Ward gives a similar account. With regard to Muhammadan education, it went down rapidly.<em> The Quinquennial Review</em> for 1907-1912 reports that in 1912 there were 1,446 Arabic and Persian schools (Madrasahs) and 8,288 Quran schools (Maktabs) as against 2,051 and 10,504 in 1907.</p>
		<p>It was natural that a foreign merchants trading company, intent on gains, should not trouble itself about the education of the people of the country, except for their own purposes. The enquiry of 1814 was due to the fact that the renewal of their Charter by Parliament was conditioned by their setting aside a lakh for educational purposes. They wanted, however, English speaking subordinate officials merely, and did nothing for the languages of the country. Deprived of all the support given by Hindu and Muslim Courts, higher education in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian and Hindi languished, and the loss of common land starved popular education to death. Nothing changes the state of a nation so rapidly as the education or noneducation of two or three generations. When Sir Charles Wood in 1854 introduced, and Government patronized, Englishspeaking schools, the masses of the people rapidly sank into ignorance. Education, in every country, must be given to the masses in their own tongue. The want of it has made India admittedly the most ignorant country in the civilized World. There is a stratum of highly educated people, and huge masses of uneducated.</p>
		<p>Matters are, however, improving, and the Indian languages are at last beginning to come into their own.</p>
		<p>The fundamental reform needed in the schools is the teaching of all subjects in the mother-tongue, and English as a second language in the Middle and High Schools, <em>modern </em>English, largely taught by conversation, by much reading aloud of interesting books, stories and short recitations. Indian history, written by Indians, must be studied to arouse and cultivate civic emotion and broad-minded patriotism. The study of literature belongs properly to the Universities, is the material of culture rather than of education.</p>
		<p>To restore the village community with the village school, the village industries, a right system of landholding and, where necessary, irrigation--these are tasks for Rulers and the Statesmen. But the work of a University is to prepare the young men and women of the nation to take up these heavy duties, these mighty tasks, demanding noble﻿ character, trained brain, and loving, well-disciplined heart, and stalwart active body.</p>
		<p>Precious to you, young men and women who are students here, should be these brief years of preparation, for if they are wasted, life will bring you no other opportunity such as you now enjoy.</p>
		<p>Before some of you to-day the door into a wider life is opened; you step over the threshold of youth into manhood and womanhood, with its duties, its burdens, its joys, its freedom to achieve and to serve. Never forget that Life can only be nobly inspired and rightly lived if you take it bravely, gallantly, as a splendid Adventure, in which you are setting out into an unknown country to face many a danger, to meet many a joy, to find many a comrade, to win and to lose many a battle. Consecrate yoursleves to-day, my young brothers and sisters, to the Service of God and Man, and you will find that both are one; that in you will show forth in His strength, in His wisdom, in His love, the Inner Ruler Immortal, and that in serving man you shall see in each you help the Hidden God, till all the world shall become radiant with the Divine Beauty, and weakness shall turn to strength, sorrow shall turn to joy, for Brahman is Bliss, and <em>Tat Twam Asi.</em>﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the University of Mysore on 14th September,1925, by the Rt. Hon'ble V.S. Srinivasa Sastri, P.C.</h1>
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>By the desire of the head of the University, who, by reason of his exalted station and personal qualities, is entitled to respect and obedience, I am now to do my part in this day's programme. Under the rules, an address suitable to the occasion has to be delivered by a member of the Senate or other person nominated by the Chancellor. Not being a member of the Senate, I come under the heading "other person." Not in itself an exacting or terrifying description, to be sure. Your predecessors listened to men who had scaled the heights of office or borne the burdens of university administration. In weighty and learned discourses, they dealt with high problems of education and educational organization, and conjured up a vision of an ideal place of learning where courses of study, professors and scholars, physical conditions and mechanical appliances, were all as they should be and left nothing to be desired. I confess I have no such ambition. Nor do I feel competent to discuss the merits of the scheme of re-organization which is now engaging the attention of local authorities. It were﻿ easy for me to endorse with a light heart the request for an assignment of ten lakhs a year for the upkeep of the university and of an undefined amount as capital outlay. Should the endorsement drag me into a consideration of Mysore finances and Mysore politics, I should only be shifted to my native element, for during a great many years now, politics has been as meat and drink to me. And if anybody were to remind me that I had not the necessary local knowledge, I should reply exultingly that I had outlived the simple time when ignorance was considered a disqualification for the office of agitator. Unencumbered by accurate information of any kind and not having to answer for the consequences, what could be easier than for me. to let fly a few random shafts which would hit ruler and subjects in tender places and leave behind a trial of mischief and embroilment? You may be thankful that the imp in me is not so highly developed. Mine be the homely task of an elder brother who seeks in confidence and love to give the benefit of his experience to the junior members of his family. Thirty-seven years ago, I left my alma mater, as most of you would presently leave yours, not without distinction. And although I cannot boast of having made fame or amassed a fortune or acquired a wide command over men, my life has enabled me to see some men and some things out of the ordinary; and it may be that, if you are attentive as well as silent for an hour or thereabouts, I shall impart some words of needed counsel and warning.﻿</p>
		<p>The most natural starting-point is the position in which we find ourselves at this present moment, I as the chosen guest, and may I add without vanity?--the spokesman of the university, and you as the finished products upon whom the ceremonial just concluded has set its authentic seal. By the regulated life that you have lived here, by the careful discipline to which your minds and bodies alike have been subjected, you are fitted, as we trust, for the trials and duties of the world, for the proper use and enjoyment of the greater measure of freedom that awaits you. For always pupilage is the necessary prelude to the liberty of the adult, and no one can ever command who has not previously learned to obey. Honour and cherish the university then as you would the mother that nursed and brought you up. Some of you will become its officers; some in time may wield great influence in shaping its future growth; others may be in a position to endow it or help in other ways; but all, high or low, distant or near, must watch its interests with anxiety and aid in the formation of that wide-spread public sympathy and public support on which alone a popular and successful university can thrive. You will be perplexed and distracted by conflicting views as to the proper aim of a university. Ability to earn a living, preparation for life and for citizenship, acquisition of knowledge and the power to add to it, formation of a good and virtuous character all these, separately or in combination, have struck theorists as the fundamental purposes of education. If you do not care to be profound or philosophical, but will be content with a common and intelligible idea, you may regard a university as a place where personality plays on personality by the establishment of an intimate human relationship between teacher and taught. This way of looking at it has the great merit of drawing attention to the supreme importance of the teacher as a factor in university life. Well-planned curricula, fully equipped laboratories, large libraries, noble halls, and imposing recreation grounds, these are good and useful things in their way. Let nobody despise them. But an able and zealous professoriate is the very life and soul of a place of learning. And in selecting its members the utmost care and circumspection are necessary. Unfortunately it is just in this part of the organization of a university that irrelevant and unworthy, consideration of race, religion or sect come into play and impair efficiency and reputation at once. A word of caution may be appropiate here. Learning knows no narrow frontiers, and a really good professor is not always to be found within a circumscribed area. Jealousy of the outsider in other spheres, and however it may gratify the popular whim for the moment, it will surely involve the sacrifice of large and permanent interests.</p>
		<p>One platitude leads to another. Having got your staff together, the next thing is to give them what is called "academic freedom". Of this the professor is frantically jealous, and the layman who takes an intelligent interest in university affairs is often startled at the thunder and lightening which a casual and innocent remark may produce﻿ in the blue sky of the Senate. Usually academic freedom is in danger from the grasping hand of bureaucracy. A great writer of educational subjects has recently said, "Standardization, government-made uniformity and bureaucratic regulation are not the allies of education but its mortal enemies." Tyrannical, deadending, soul-killing are the mild epithets in the vocabulary of the irate pedagogue when he wishes to characterize the control of the authority which bears a great part, sometimes, as here, much the greater part, of the burden of university finance. The maxim "he who pays the piper will call the tune" is summarily ruled out here. Government is to be like the postal peon, who delivers a money order, but cannot stay to see where the money is kept or how it is disposed of. The encroachment of the State, however, is encroachment by cultivated people and, therefore, mitigable by reasoning and negotiation. But in these days of expanding democracy the sanctity of the temple of learning is subject to a grater danger from sudden inroads of popular clamour and prejudice, miscalled public opinion. That variety of politician whom we call by the disrespectful name of demagogue at times attains a tremendous influence which sweeps aside professor and professorial regulation. People uprisen have no use for the expert. Standards may be lowered the medium of instruction changed, and discipline undermined, the teacher hiding his diminished head the while. To you, who have felt and can never cease to appreciate the tender and delicate relation of <em>guru</em> and <em>sishya,</em> and who know how an atmosphere of prejudice and passion is inimical to the scientific pursuit of knowledge, to you, I say, graduates of the University, scattered far and near, and able by your numbers and influence to control these turbulent squalls before they attain their fury, the authorities of the university have the right to look with confidence for energetic and timely interposition. In such moments of peril, do not, I pray you, stand looking on or mumbling excuses for the insurgents, but come round your <em>alma mater</em> and guard her like valiant and faithful sons.</p>
		<p>After the University, but not below it in rank or precedence, I would mention your State as entitled to your homage and loyal service. In extent and size of population, in natural resources, in salubrity of climate, Mysore does not come behind many Indian States. In variety and charm of natural scenery and in possession of places of historical and architectural interest, believe me, who can speak with some knowledge, she has few superiors. The history of the areas comprised in her territory, so far as it has been studied, discloses periods of prosperity and stable government, and is brightened by deeds of valour and episodes of romance, of which you may well be proud. The culture of her people, their aptitude for crafts and industries, their literature and their love of music and the fine arts, are not easily surpassed. As for her highly evolved administration and the extent to which personal rule has been surperseded by the reign of impersonal and﻿ impartial law, for the high level of efficiency and purity of her services, and for the devotion displayed by the sovereign towards the welfare of his subjects and his keen desire to respect their wishes and such constitutional rights as they possess, why, by almost universal consent, Mysore is second to none among Indian States. Does not such a home deserve all the passionate love and filial devotion of which you are capable? It is a mean--one might almost say, monstrous--spirit which scans with cold precision the qualities of one's mother, and measures gratitude and service accordingly. On the most material calculation of the opportunities that Mysore affords for the full development of your faculties and the rewards which may be expected for high-class industry and enterprise in any sphere, the keenest wits and stoutest hearts among you need not feel themselves thrown away on this country and her advancement. Go out and spread into every nook and comer, leave the big towns where all the avenues to success are over-thronged, and try what patient toil and scientific organization can do to make field and rock, forest and hill, yield their utmost for man's benefit. You have fine irrigation works, of which full advantage has yet to be taken. Let not jungle and malaria beat you back for ever. Jungle and malaria have yielded elsewhere to axe and fire, drainage schemes and prophylactics. Lack of large capital in individual hands can at least in part be met by many-sided cooperation under the aegis of an indigenous and enlightened government, which will be only too glad to provide expert﻿ guidance and financial guarantees for any well-considered schemes by which the methods and appliances of science will be employed in exploiting natural resources. It has been truly said that the engineer, taking him in all his grades and kinds, is of all human agencies the most valuable, nay, indispensable, for the economic growth and material prosperity of a country. A state which produced Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya need not suffer at any time from a paucity of engineering talent.</p>
		<p>Do not infer from my recommending this course that I am trying to divert your attention from politics. Whoever might do so, I could not unless I wished to stultify myself completely. By all means strive to improve your political status. Only let me entreat you to remember two things. You have cause to be thankful that you are subjects of the most progressive and well-governed State in India. Engrossment in local politics is apt to engender a narrow provincialism and even for full efficacy in its own sphere, may require to be corrected by study of Indian affairs.</p>
		<p>Many of you will seek careers in the employ of Government. No inducement is necessary in that direction. On the contrary, you may have encountered in your reading several appeals, more or less cogent, against the general notion that in Government service one finds the most honourable scope for one's talents. I have never been able to join in this fashionable crusade. As the point is of some consequence, let me keep you a few moments 14﻿ on it. In British India to a great extent and in the States to a much greater extent, the official class are a great power. Their prestige and authority were in former times unquestioned and even now remain strong, far beyond what they would be if the men were private individuals. Sometimes when an officer was scrupulous and high-principled, this vast influence was used for benign purposes, and we have all heard of many foundations of charity and public utility which owed their origin either to their munificence or to the munificence induced by them. More often, however, I grieve to say, it was grossly abused, and the tyranny thus practised over a long period of our history has led to the popular saying that the official tyrant is one of the six scourges that our race has to suffer for its sins. Custom might occasionally be relaxed, laws and regulations could be evaded, drought and flood were occasional, dacoity was rare, but the pressure of the king's man, armed with tyrannous power and spreading everywhere, knew no seelp; it was heavy and harsh; it destroyed the self-reliance and initiative of the common people; public spirit, resistance to the oppressor were unknown. The submissive and servile nature of the people was so marked that in the famous resolution of Lord Ripon on Local Self-Government it was euphemistically described as our remarkable power of acquiescence. If this incubus weighing on the hearts of our folk is ever to be lifted, it must be through generations of conscientious officers drawn from those whose hearts have been trained to the appreciation of humane ideals.﻿ It is a common place of our administrative history that a great uplift in the standards both of efficiency and purity has been brought about by the appointment of university men to places of control and authority. More and more as representative institutions are introduced, it is necessary to provide for them a stable and strong foundation in national character. Love of freedom and readiness to repel encroachment on it from any quarter, a keen sense of the rights of the private citizen as well as his duties, these elements have to be built into the very fibre of our people, and whom could we safely trust with this noble and benign mission if not the wisest, the noblesthearted and the most chivalrously disposed among you? The good work has happily gone on for some years, but it must continue for a long, long time yet, if the blighting effects of centuries of misrule are to be obliterated. Go then and take office; but in order to put it to this high use, look upon the ryots and the labourers as children committed to your care, whom you must bring up in the ways to use big words in a small context, of self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control. Treat them with consideration and courtesy; use polite forms of address; and give a sympathetic ear to their representations; so that they may learn that you are there to understand, to help, to serve. So would you truly and faithfully represent His Highness to his subjects. So would you, like a thousand well-trained hands, carry out in all corners of his realm his inmost wishes.</p>
		<p>An important task rests on you as educated men and women to keep up the intellectual curiosity awakened in you by your varied studies and add fresh knowledge to the store here accumulated. Nothing distinguishes true culture from false so surely as this inquisitive spirit, the desire to keep abreast with the best thought of the world, to knew things as far as possible in their essence and thoroughly. Unfortunately many of us have heavy cares and duties, our posts are often in out-of-the-way places, where. books are rare and congenial friends still rarer. We get little time for the exercise of our higher minds, so completely are we engulfed in the petty details and routine of daily duty. For persons in such desperate case may we not prescribe a well-thumbed classic or two as constant companions? Each has his favourites and perhaps changes them every few years. But to them he may return again and again and slake his thirst as at an ever-living spiritual fountain. The greater part of us, however, will live in more favoured sports where our minds need not starve except through our own neglect. Alas! such neglect and starvation are too common. It would be ungracious to enlarge on this topic, but let any one mention half a dozen large towns where of a Sunday afternoon one might go to the local club or reading room with the hope of listening to an elevated conversation on the topics of the day, or to a public debate in which a subject was discussed so as to stimulate the mind, suggest fresh points or create a zest for further enquiry. Somehow after we﻿ leave college, a sort of mental exhaustion seems to set in from which only a few recover. Do you remember that famous story of Dr. Johnson? Once while he was recovering from an illness, someone proposed to send for Burke. "Don't!", cried the Doctor, "if that fellow were to appear now, it would kill me at once. He calls forth all my mental powers." Without having the excuse of physical debility, we seem to be in mortal dread of having to listen to a lively debate on a rousing topic, let alone taking part in them. In a certain measure this undesirable phenomenon occurs elsewhere as well. I was surprised, while reading a book by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, President of the Columbia University, to come upon the following passage:</p>
		<p>"Speaking not long ago in the City of New York, Israel Zangwill paid us the compliment of saying thet we Americans are the best halfeducated people in the world. My impression is that he put the fraction rather high. If we measure our education by the expenditure of moneys, public and private, upon schools of every type and sort, then plainly. these amoints are enormous. If we measure our education by the number of pupils under formal instruction for some part of each year, the numbers dre certainly agreeably large. If we measure our education by the splendour of the school buildings which of late have been erected in a thousand communities scattered throughout the land and by the excellence of their equipment, then assuredly the impression is most flattering. If, on the other hand, we seek for those surer evidences of education which are marked by correctness and precision in the use of the mothertongue, by refined and gentle manners which are the expression of fixed habits﻿ of thought and action, by the power and habit of relfection and the use of scientific method in the approach to new problems of public and personal import, or by the power of intellectual and moral growth, then it may well be, doubted whether the results are quite so flattering."</p>
		<p>Some may feel a little comforted after reading this passage, but I fear it applies to the facts of India with much greater force than to those of America. It is the privilege of Convocation orators to formulate counsels of perfection to their bored audiences, and if I appear to tread in their path at this point, I can only plead in defence that I do not consider my suggestion a counsel of perfection. Outside the requirements of our profession, newspapers form the pabulum of our reading. But oftentimes an important topic comes up in which the interest is maintained for several weeks, and each man misses something or other necessary for full comprehension. Hardly a month passes without two or three such topics emerging. Suppose a fair-sized town in which twenty people joined together and procured access to a few magazines and newspapers. Let us imagine them to meet one specified day every month at which it was the duty of one member or two, as the case may be, to give a connected account of two selected matters from his reading. You could on such an occasion hear all about fundamentalism, the trial at Dayton and some of the arguments used on both sides, at least the Biblical passages relied on by Bryan. The discussion that followed might ramify in several interesting issues. The theory of evolution would naturally come in,﻿ and a member of wider reading than ordinary would perhaps outline the modifications that had been made since Darwin's day. Another would draw a picture of the personality of Bryan, so simple and yet of such vivid interest. You might hear of Bryan's visit to India and the violent antipathy evoked in Anglo-Indian society by the book in which he recorded his experienoes. A member with a turn for practical speculation-pardon the paradoxical expression-might invite his audience to consider what would happen in some of our provinces in the extremely probable contingency of a majority passing obscurantist laws of the kind under which Mr. Scopes was convicted and enforcing them. The coal crisis in England, the security pact, the Indian disability in Thanganyika with special reference to the British mandate, the questions involved in the reference to the Skeen Committee these are only some of the numerous illustrations that might be brought forward for proving the great intellectual benefit that such a league or association would confer on the locality. By spending an hour at one of these monthly meetings you could learn a lot of interesting and useful matter which it would take much time and energy to find for yourself. This might seem child's diet to grave and reverend professors hankring after philosophical speculations and recent scientific advances. But the busy professional man, whom I ain thinking of, would do well, at least in the beginning, to avoid strong meat. Whenever you hold such a meeting, go not, I warn you, too near the chess board or the bridge table lest by heedless chatter﻿ you distract minds intent on vital and intricate problems. Nor should you allow any but a poor man's tea to refresh you; rich hosts have a captivating way of giving precedence to the body over the mind, and the discussion would shift its object almost entirely. One more caution, if you please, before I pass on. If the principal speaker appointed for the day happen to be a lawyer in good practice, do not forget to provide yourself with a handy substitute; for some witless client may remove him at the last moment to a more profitable debate, and not even allow him to give you due notiee.</p>
		<p>Even more than this mental alertness and elasticity, another attribute is distinctive of university culture-the balanced mind. Sad to think, it is also the rarer. I once had to speak to an association of graduates in Australia, and posed the query, "Do modern universities aim at a balanced mind?" From the tenor of ensuing conversation I could see that other minds had been agitated over the problem. Once upon a time the true mark of a completed course of education was the habit of proving all things before coming to a judgement, the disposition to look at a matter from all points of a view, the habit even under exciting circumstances of bringing full and unclouded reason to bear on the subject at issue. Modern life with its hurry and whirl seems to have banished leisure, poise, serenity of outlook. The countless little details claiming our attention from moment to moment scarcely allow of the formation of a whole and harmonious picture with every feature in true perspective. The newspaper press, shouting and screaming the whole day long, keeps pouring into our minds a chaos of unrelated thoughts. Of any particular object or idea we seem only to catch a fleeting phase, an aspect of an aspect. And yet we have to make up our minds, to choose our sides, and to cast our votes. We could not hold our judgements in suspense if we would, and, for a wonder, most of us would not if we could. We do not seem even to care for justice, harmony, coordination. In the legislalture we hear only partisan views of things, and, if we wish to count for something, we must give partisan votes. How the laws in such a dispensation can be just and suitable is no concern of our. In the courts, clients, witnesses, advocates are all naturally for their own side of the case and make no attempt to disguise the fact. The result, as we all know, is that the judge is often hindered from discovering the truth, not helped to do so. So in the public discussion of questions between conservatives and reformers, capital and labour, and so forth, the active spirits throw themselves heart and soul into one side or other of the dispute. Newspapers, instead of endeavouring to create a sober and healthy public opinion, are avowedly partisan and, while presenting their side in attractive colours, consider it no part of their duty to be equally generous to the other side and in many cases misrepresent, suppress and run it down. So far has this evil grown that young and inexperienced readers, taught only by one set of papersbe innate cursedness and moral﻿ perversity to the other school of thought and its advocates. Among us the situation is further complicated by the upsurging of the communal spirit, the various sects and factions demanding each its share and more than its share, and leaving the State altogether in the lurch. The modern machinery for striking the balance, commissions, and committees and assessors, are but imperfect and untrustworthy approximations. The personnel of these bodies on which hang vital issues of equity and justice is itself made a subject of acrimonious contention. Where all are tainted, few can be expected to hold the scales even. Do our universities, let me put the question though I do not expect an answer- with their ever increasing specialization of studies produce of set purpose the type of mind necessary for discovering the golden mean, the safe middle course between opposing tendencies? Is there no use, even in these tranquil places dedicated to truth and wisdom, for the man who hesitates, who weighs arguments with care, who resists the sway of passion? A recent Governor of one of our provinces, who had been a radical in English politics, turned out to be unprogressive here. He once explained the phenomenon to me. He sought advice from every quarter on a disputed issue, he read all the papers dealing with it. The rights and wrongs seemed to him so equally balanced that the case for change was never wholly made out. So, he said he left the old arrangement continue, it had answered so far. He was a typical conservative, a perfect Hamlet of politics. But surely deliberation is not indecision. It will lead to action quite as often as to inaction. And the action to which it leads will be﻿ safe and suited to all the attendant circumstances. I freely admit that the conscientious politician is not popular. His counsel of patience and moderation is irritating to eager and enthusiastic natures, Yudhishthira was called many ugly names by Bhima and Droupadi. But he did not allow himself to be hustled. "Unagitated like the sea, immoveable like the mountain" he waited till the time arrived and then struck and struck home. The crossbencher is not beloved of his tribe, but the cross-bench mind is an ever-present and an ever-growing need. Believe me, it is no disease, no infirmity. On the other hand, it is the crown and summit of liberal education. It would be an evil day when it became extinct, and the high function of universities is to foster it with tender and unremitting care.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the University of Mysore on 27th November 1926, by Sir P.C. Ray</h1>
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>Ten years ago when I had the good fortune of being present on the historic occasion of the inaugural ceremony of your University, I rejoiced to find that a very momentous step had been taken by one of the most distinguished and far-seeing rulers of India. Since then, I have always been closely watching the progress of your University, little thinking that I should, one day, be called upon to deliver its Convocation Address. Allow me, therefore, to offer my sincere thanks for the honour you have done me and to assure you how greatly I value it.</p>
		<p>At the very outset I must confess that I feel not a little nervous to address you in the presence of a ViceChancellor whose encyclopaedic knowledge and attainments and whose extraordinary power of synthesis are, at once, the wonder and despair of literary men in India. It is, therefore, on your patience and kindness that I must rely to be able to discharge my task successfully.</p>
		<p>Mysore is one of the most progressive and enlightened Feudatory States in India, and the experiment which you have started here is being watched with intense interest all over the country by persons connected with Universities not only in sister States but also in British India proper. I shall avail myself of this opportunity to give expression to my thoughts on certain aspects of the educational institutions, both at home and abroad, have forced upon me. The clearness with which the vision of an ideal University stands before me to-day is, undoubtedly, the result of the great process of elimination working, consciously or unconsciously, for more than thirty years of my educational experience; and let me not be misunderstood if I begin by saying that the problem of education, here or elsewhere, has, in the main, not been handled with that intelligence and sagacity which it deserves. To be frank, we in India have, since the British occupation of our country, always regarded our educational problems from a point of view which is purely British. Though it may not be true of the present moment, there is, I am sure, no one here who can deny the fact that until very recently we, Indians, conveniently relegated the task of evolving our educational institutions to our rulers who, as it was natural for them, transplanted <em>their home</em> institutions to our soil.</p>
		<p>The outstanding difference between the ancient or mediaeval University and the modern is the merely cultural aspect of the former and the cultural and vocational traits of the latter. In ancient and mediaeval times, the differences between University and school education were instinctively regulated both as regards extent and object. This was possible as many of the learned professions had not then﻿ 	been clearly outlined nor had so many come into existence. The system offered a more or less satisfactory solution of the ordinary educational requirements of the people of the time, the higher learning being mainly sought by those who had "scholarly instincts." With the coming into existence of many learned professions later on, social and economic necessity led many more to seek training in these higher institutions (or Universities) but when the inrush became disproportionate to the demand, and some of the universities, through want of proper perception, allowed their halls to be used as 'marts' and not 'mines', the unsuitable character of the modern system became apparent.</p>
		<p>We thus notice the more thoughtful Universities changing their character from an examining' body to a 'teaching' one. I confess that a certain amount of 'examining' trait must exist in all Universities as the business of life requires that we must judge. But to lay more stress on this than on the creative side of human intellectual efforts would reduce them to the condition of commercial coaching establishments. There must be separate institutions for such particular feats as training for the competitive Civil Services, but here in the University our motto should be 'Advancement of Learning.</p>
		<p>I shall now try to prove that unless such distinctions are introduced into our educational system, the functions of our Universities would be too unwieldy and that a clear demarcation between the school and University efforts is, under a healthy condition, inevitable. As I have said﻿ on many occasions we cannot in life escape an assortment, be it biological or intellectual. Whilst biological selection often ruthlessly puts aside the infirm and the weak, in the intellectual world, goaded by social instincts and thie idea of social or State responsibility, an effort is made to equip' a man on the score of his intellect. To sharpen the intellect or illuminate the mind up to a certain extent is not difficult with most men, but intellect that can create is a rarity, and the development of such an intellect if undertaken in an organization must needs be different from the less gifted ones. Whilst general education is a necessity-so beautifully represented in the Soviet Educational Poster by a blinded man about to fall down a precipice, and to-day a birth right with most, the higher cultural centres are useless for their immediate purpose. The demarcation is thus clearly based upon intellectual capacity.</p>
		<p>I have already indicated that most Universities exist for two purposes: for the training of men and women for certain professions, and secondly, for the sake of pure learning. It is obvious how the functions of the two, though different both physically and morally, are quite interdependent. True, the practice of existing knowledge may do for a number of years, sometimes for a generation perhaps, but soon its effects weaken and new knowledge is realized to be a necessity in the life of mankind for its very progress. Tius the merely practical education in the Universities would have to be filliped and given a direction by original research. Between the unalloyed investigator and the practical﻿ utilitarian there are necessarily many gradations which fill up University activities, and I would rather, that each understood his vocation so that pure learning could flourish and for ever continue to replenish the bowl of human understanding. If this is our ideal, our methods of achieving the same must be shaped accordingly.</p>
		<p>If we begin by critically examining our methods in India (not only in your University) the first outrage that we find we committed was in making a foreign language our vehicle of instruction. It is surprising that this principal reason for our intellectual sterility was not discovered till very recently, and it is still more surprising to find that some of the well-known educationists of the time continue to regard this relegation of the English language to an inferior position as fraught with disastrous consequences! To avoid misconception, I must here, once for all, make it clear that the study of English or other important foreign languages is by no means discouraged; they open up newer vistas of thoughts and ideals; there is no need of entertaining the fear that the language in which Shakespeare and Milton wrote will be left uncultivated. Only it must not be looked upon as the medium of instruction. A man of education must, in the first place, be one well up in allround information, and he can gather it best and in the minimum of time if he does so in a language he learned to lisp in, while sucking his mother's breast the language of his nursery. Arithmetic, History, Economics, Politics, Logic and Geography, in short the book of knowledge, can readily be mastered﻿ in one's own vernacular. That should be the first stone in our educational edifice if we want to build well and high!</p>
		<p>Everyone will admit that with an improved and broadened form of secondary education, the functions of the Universities will be stripped of many of their unnecessary appendages, making thus for real progress. The mechanical portion of training, which ought really to be finished in the school stage, but which unfortunately is carried on to the University forms, will then greatly disappear and make these Universities real centres of learning and culture. I fear a good deal of explanation is necessary at this point, mainly because the present University system is as yet so full of routine details that its function is not very far removed from that of a Secondary School. Even in the post-graduate stage there are some who would insist on definite exercises! I do not for a moment suggest that in the Universities under the cloak of freedom of choice of study any indolence should flourish. The habit of industry in addition to intellectual capacity should form the primary condition of continuance in the University, All that is implied is that the numerous compulsory class lectures and exercises that form to-day the basis of education in the Universities should be abolished if the intellectual capacity of University students is to develop. No doubt the lecture system gives an appearance of work, but if the student is himself willing to utilize his time, he would in most cases find that he gets through more work by absenting himself from these compulsory lectures.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-20">*</a></sup> The greatest disadvantage of the compulsory lecture system arises from the fact that those that attend can only under exceptional cases ask questions to clear their difficulty, and as is only natural, the teacher only explains his own view-point. To remedy these evils, the tutorial system is being introduced in some Universities; but although this latter partially supplements the incompleteness of the former method, its general effect, so far as I am aware, is more of the nature of coaching without intellectual effort. Just consider the opposite system where the student is only given the names of some books and some questions on the problems dealt therein; he reads them, digests them and develops his own answers to the questions by a process of thinking which is his own, and then in the College Seminary discusses them from his own point of view with his colleagues and professors, preferably in limited groups. I am sure under these circumstances his powers of analysis as well as synthesis will be better developed, and his efforts, though irksome in the beginning, will soon enable him to carve out his own intellectual empire. All these, however, presuppose a sound secondary education.</p>
		<p>The question may be asked, if the lecture system be abolished, what should be the function of professors? The answer is obvious the function of the professor should be mainly original research. Where he feels he has something new to impart, he lectures, he discourses and thus keeps the spirit of enquiry for ever alive and growing in this intellectual democracy. In the words of Bertrand Russell, skill in pedagogy in University teaching is no longer important.</p>
		<p>I may be now allowed to review in short the workings of my own University, I mean that of Calcutta, from the point of view of the ideals laid down above. While regretting that our secondary system is most deplorably deficient for which the medium of education is not inconsiderbly responsible, the post-graduate system developedby that illustrious educationist, the late Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, approaches my conception of University deal. Its highest ideals are conterminous with absolute intellectual freedom, the full realization of which is unhappily being hampered by financial inadequacy. I shall not be guilty of high treason against my Alma Mater if I choose to infer that to meet this inadequacy, we have been forced, to a certain extent at any rate, to keep both the secondary and degree courses of instruction tied to our apron strings. The effect of such a system is that healthy elimination for which I stand is secured only partially, and necessarily the beneficent effect of the post-graduate system is reduced. In those﻿ sections of the post-graduate department, for instance, the science sections where limited accommodation practically ensures rigorous elimination where the munificence of farseeing donors have placed teaching and research on a comparatively sounder basis, the record of work and the output of original contribution are by no means unworthy The workers in the College of Science, students and teachers alike, come into that intimate contact with one another which is truly characteristic of an intellectual democracy. On the other hand, in the Arts section where by the very nature of circumstances already alluded to, the elimination is far less, though the teachers themselves are a distinguished brotherhood, each contributing to the stock of human knowledge lose that most important of all opportunities, - the contact with the inner workings of the teacher. That I consider as the greatest loss in a University system! While hoping that improvement of the lower forms of education will soon remove these difficulties in our University system, I cannot help noticing with regret that in the executive organizations of our academic system, the student element is entirely absent. Nothing teaches a man more than responsibility, and the feeling that he is of the system. In Soviet Russia, this method of introducing the student element in the executive bodies of schools and colleges has been productive of such good results that we outsiders, who really care to make our educational institutions part and parcel of our organic growth, should lose no time in adopting this novel system.﻿</p>
		<p>I have so far then pointed out four of the main defects of our University educational system:<em>the medium of study, the absence of elimination, the system of compulsory lectures, and the non-participation of students in the organization.</em> Of the many other defects probably the one that deserves next consideration is the notion of regarding Universities as preserves for certain hall--marked people. This exclusiveness had any meaning so long as we believed that our system of preparatory education was infallible and that we could include within its fold all our educable people. Such cliams are on the very face of them absurd, and when once we admit that the Universities should function as great research centres, their portals should be opened wide to any one, hall-marked or not, who has given evidence of originality or keenness. It will be difficult to assert for any educationist that such a catholicity will not make for much progress. On the contrary, knowing what a minute fraction of our people are receiving education, the hopeful uncertainty of 'full many a flower is born to blush unseen', would justify this departure from the orthodox notion of exclusiveness. If one took a census of the greatest of world's men and women, I fear he would be surprised to discover that the majority of them owe very little to Universities or indeed to any educational system. Shakespeare knew little Greek and less Latin. Our Keshab Chandra Sen and Rabindranath, Sarat Chandra Chaterjee, the prince of novelists and sotry-writers, Girish Chandra Ghose, the foremost of our dramatists, never crossed the threshold﻿ of the University. Whilst on the one hand, therefore, the charge of handling mediocrity in the University system is not altogether unfounded, the current Emersonian aphorism that 'Universities are hostile to genius', is, on the other hand, not wholly justifiable. Whilst Universities should be anxious to invite real workers for human progress, we on our part should see that they are rendered independent to do so. If I may quote from Mr. Wells, 'they (future Universities) will offer no general education at all, no graduation in arts or science or wisdom. The only students who will come to them will be young people who are specially attracted and who want to work in close relation as assistants, secretaries, special pupils, collateral investigators with the devoted and distinguished men whose results are teaching all the world.</p>
		<p>I will now turn to the consideration of the 'regional character of your University, a circumstance from which a State cannot perhaps escape when it undertakes to control and maintain its whole educational system. It is clear that the success or failure of this regional scheme depends entirely upon the broad-mindedness of the State itself, and on the contiuance of the policy of co-operation between its various departments and the University. In short, a regional university is often made to synchronise with the political phases of its originator, the State, and as such its destiny is uncertain. I am, therefore, ever conscious of the limitations of such a system from the point of view of the highest educational ideal. Looking, however, from the practical point of view, such a scheme is the only rational one to be followed by a self-contained State, and in fact paradoxical as it may seem from its name, it does not ordinarily exclude the ideals and aspirations of a University in the widest possible sense. A very important issue has to my mind been raised by this departure of yours. I will explain it by referring to the case of the Dacca University of our province which unfortunately is essentially a replica of the Calcutta University. Now my contention is, 'Was it necessary within the same province and with 16 hours of easy communication to duplicate an institution? Would it not have been much better to create in Dacca a University centre having special reference to the study of agriculture, jute, hide, fishery, forest products, boat and bridge-building, etc., and thus supplement the courses falling short in Calcutta and introduce research on problems of local interest?' To me it appears wanton; raising of stereotyped Universities without regard to 'regional' considerations is wasting economic power. And more. The very functions of Universities which are so fundamentally different from those of schools are made to approximate each other. Let us not then call such Universities by that dignified name, or if that is to be, the abode of our highest ideals of education and culture must be christened otherwise. Unfortunately, the misunderstanding of the fiunctions of the two is too common, and we have thus amidst us a system which satisfies the requirements of neither. No wonder, therefore, the share of Indian contribution﻿ to the stock of world's modern culture and knowledge is as yet so small! Now, in your University if you are strictly logical in your conception of regional university, you cannot go on adding faculty after faculty without due consideration to your regional needs. Naturally this remark does not apply so well to the humanistic faculties; but so far as the science faculties are concerned, it would be only proper if you rather stuck on to your regional notions. Thereby you will not only have introduced economy in your education, but will have made the University a living consulting body on matters of technical importance. Thus the University will ultimately be a productive institution, thriving by its own potence and not obliged to go round with the begging bowl! The vast industrial enterprises owned or initiated by the State will be the training ground of not only those that will subsequently choose industrial career, but will afford untold facilities to the expert investigators of the University, whose discoveries will bring wealth and fame to the State! This is an advantage which we in Calcutta cannot claim. As it is, the State departments or State manufactories are practically sealed books, and then there are not very many of them.</p>
		<p>I want here to make a few observations in connection with your intended department of technology about which I found a reference in your Vice-Chancellor's remarkable introductory speech on the Report of the University Reorganization Committee on the 28th November, last year. Our experience of University technological education dates from six years back. The department was started with a pupil and colleague of mine at its head, well-trained both in the Universities and factories at home and abroad. Thoroughly conversant with local industrial conditions, and conscious of the inadequacy of fundamental training in the schools and colleges, he has been forced to make a compromise between the higher University ideal and the technical degree course. I frankly admit, he could do no better under the existing circumstances, when the race has first to be brought up to an industrial consciousness; and till the preparatory diploma and degree courses are satisfactorily established, our University effort in this direction will continue to be an amalgamation of the two.</p>
		<p>The question may be asked why was it then that the technological course in the University was started without previously creating diploma and degree courses? The answer is not unknown to your Vice-Chancellor. The princel gift of the late Sir Rashbihari Ghose brought this course of study within the curriculum of the University, and although the main object of the endowment is to promote research in technology which is being so successfully fulfilled in the departments of Applied Chemistry and Physics, the creation of post-graduate courses in them was found necessary to recruit specially trained young men for the very purpose of research on the one hand, and for supplying the demand of manufacturing concerns on the other. The experience of the last six years has thus placed in our possession useful data for initiation of the junior courses which are contemplated at an early date, and as every year is passing, we are noticing a conspicuous improvement in the quality of the trained young men who, we hope, will soon prove their usefulness by being captains of industry! But in this happy expectation I am forced to strike a note of aged despondency. As I have already said, the advantage which your University students enjoy to day or would continue to enjoy till many years, is not in the luck of the Bengalee students. Already signs of over-production in the technological department are in evidence, and I fear if the productive industries do not increase in number or extend their enterprises, their education would be an economic waste. If, on the other hand, in spite of their University education, they would view manual labour in its true perspective and realize its dignity, they would continue to earn their living no less satisfactorily than the so-called lucky 'Service' men. I know there are hundreds of uneducated soap-makers on the other side of the Canal in Calcutta whose capital ranges from Rs. 500 to Rs. 50,000 who are their own experts, managers, salesmen, or boiling men, plying a successful trade, whilst our educated young men with spectacles, chair and table, are unable to support themselves. This should be an eye-opener. Lord Leverhulme's example should stimulate them. He commenced his career as an apprentice in a small grocer's shop. Whilst cheerfully preparing to embrace manual labour, they should be happy in the consciousness that their education has given them an advantage over their uneducated competitors in that the key to the secrets﻿ of nature is in their possession it is now for them to wait and opportunately use it. I wish it were otherwise but I regret that our social and educational systems are equally responsible for this state of utter helplessness of our young men. Degeneration started by the absence of a general sustaining ideal in the nation, a life of luxury and self-indulgence with some or the most depressing poverty with most, soon bring the brightest of our young men to a state of both intellectual and physical torpor. And education which should have elevated them, completes their wreck by supplying notes and digests!</p>
		<p>Few probably pause to think now-a-days what the austere system of our past stood for, and what priceless reward in the shape of of self-reliance it gave. In the abundance of heritage we are forgetting how to keep it. Of Carlyle and his contemporaries his biographer Froude says.</p>
		<p>"They had no one to look after them either on their journey or when they came to the end. They walked from their homes, being unable to pay for their coachhire. They entered their own names at the college. They found their own humble lodgings and were left entirely to their own capacity for self-conduct. The carriers brought them oat-meal, potatoes and salt, butter from the home farm, with a few eggs occasionally as a luxury. With their thrifty habits, they required no other food. In the return cart; their linen went back to their mothers to be washed and mended. Poverty protected them from﻿ temptations to vicious amusements. They shared their breakfasts and thoughts and had their clubs for conversation or discussion. When term was over, they walked home in parties, each district having its little knot belonging to it; and known along the roads as University Scholars, they were assured of entertainment on the way. As a training in self-dependence, no better education could have been found in these Islands."</p>
		<p>I would earnestly plead, therefore, whether one is a votary of technology or of the school of Humanity, that the University of Mysore do not spare itself in checking those elements in its educational system which may tend to subvert self-help in the student community. "Live hard", as said the iron philosopher, and yours will be the golden harvest.</p>
		<p>Now, returning back to technology: A State or a country that aspires to be economically independent must develop all its natural resources to the fullest. As in a land where agriculture is the common source of living, the people must be agricultural in their bend, so must you who aspire after developing your natural resources create a technical bend amongst your population. It is a type of economic development with which Indians came to be acquainted only recently, and unlike agriculture, its manipulation and utilization would have to be acquired by bringing into existence altogether different traditions even in our primary schools. The mechanical bend of mind would have to be fostered, and the powers of accurate﻿ observation and experiment would have to be cultivated not at a later stage as is being done to-day, but from the very beginning. This is very important, and in fact the usual habit of feeling satisfaction at having been able to do a thing good enough must be discouraged. I know if I were to ask twenty young men here to measure a piece of wood, probably all of them would come near enough the true measurement, but not one would give its true dimension. These near-enough habits would have to be eradicated if any real success in technical education is to be achieved. Mechanical education which we were inclined to despise, the kindergarten methods and the like so powerful in developing observational powers in children, would have to be introduced to bring within the fold of education many more children whom we had by our older methods given up as hopeless.</p>
		<p>I would just quote the working routine of a German school for very young boys and pass on [ Lexis, Vol. iv):</p>
		<p><img src="images/001.jpg" alt="images" /></p>
		<p>It would appear from the above that Drawing and Nature Study are included as courses of instruction even at the infant stage. Their significance need not be dilated upon. Whilst the latter supplies the themes, the former is as though the language of the Machine age!</p>
		<p>So great is the demand of modern civilization on classified and conscious knowledge that to overlook science and its practice even at the very early stage of teaching is no longer justifiable. The apparent difficulty in introducing such studies at the infant stage arises mainly from our erroneous method of instruction. If the themes come first, the interest of children is so far excited that in the very effort to probe into them they will, ungrudgingly learn the disciplines. Thus in the course of studying phenomena, they will be compelled to get enough exercise in reading, writing and arithmetic. There is no danger that they will fail to learn these things without which they cannot study any of the themes. Herein comes the use of museums, galleries, exhibitions and the like, which are uptil to-day being used only by the adult, and that too indifferently. A large number of real teachers is thus necessary if we want to put the whole educational machinery into a correct form. And, as every well-trained child is an asset to the State, which ultimately brings wealth and prosperity to it, I leave it to the State to find out what position education should occupy in its Budget. Economy in education is a misnomer.</p>
		<p>Gentlemen, I have yet two more points to emphasize upon before I conclude to-day. The first is essentially connected with inter-University relationship, and the second, the establishment of central institutes in different parts of India for promotion of research. The usual practice of inviting specialists for short courses of lectures though stimulating, is to my mind only a makeshift. If these distinguished men could be persuaded to reside in our Universities for periods of not less than six months, the impetus which we would then receive, and the research they would then be able to initiate would have lasting effect on the workings of the University. This intellectual exchange will lead not only to progressive realization of human cultural aspirations, but will bring in its train a deeper sympathy for the world of human relationship. In that state, Brahmin, a non-Brahmin, a Muhammadan or a Christian, the yellow, brown, black or the white will vanish, but they all will be considered a unit in the brotherhood of men.</p>
		<p>The establishment of central research institutes is not a new phenomenon in this State, and Mysore probably has shown its highest appreciation of this system by her generous support to the Indian Institute of Science. I only deplore that in this continent of India where Nature has been so bounteous, many more institutes like the one in Bangalore should not already have sprung to explore into her resources. There can be no question to-day that human efforts, whether cultural or material, should abandon that straggling and isolated career of the past, and consent to team-work. These central institutes would have to divest themselves from all 'regional traits and work in harmony for the common good of the nation. Without being so, they can never be international.</p>
		<p>Gentlemen, I will now conclude by showing you once again before I part what colossal waste of national intelligence, we have allowed in the past by our scheme of University education, and how unqualified for the practical matters of life we emerge out of this machinery. I shall allude to the most heart-rending analysis of the situation by no less a man than Mr. K Srinivasa Iyengar who in the course of his Vice-Chancellor's speech in 1920 stated:</p>
		<p>"Of 18,500 graduates of the University of Madras whose careers have been traced, some 3,700 have spent their lives in Government or administrative service, about an equal number are engaged in the teaching profession, and nearly 6,000 have gone into law. Medicine has had only 765 devotees, Commerce only 100, and Science a tiny fraction of the whole, 56." "You will search in vain," said he, "for any solid contribution to the sum of human knowledge amongst this magnificent number of 18,500"!</p>
		<p>On top of this comes the news communicated only the other day by the Associated Press:</p>
		<p>"Owing to large flux of candidates about one thousand four hundred and fifty in number taking degrees in person this year, the Syndicate of Madras University has decided to hold two convocations next Thursday, the first being held at 2 P.M., presided over by the Vice-Chancellor and lasting for about half an hour. The second convocation will be held at 4-30 P.M., the same day at which the Chancellor will preside."</p>
		<p>In other words, the two Universities of Calcutta and Madras have become two huge factories for massproduction of Graduates! This inordinate, insane craze almost a mania--for securing a degree has been working infinite mischief- it has become almost a canker eating into the very vitals of intellectual life and progress. A serious drawback incidental to, and I am afraid, almost inseparable from the present ill-understood and misconceived notions of University training is that the young men thus turned out betrays, as a rule, lamentable lack of initiative, resourcefulness and pluck when he is thrown upon the world and has to fight his way through it. The testimony of some of the greatest of men in Science or in practical business will reveal the urgent need for reform in our Universities. "I would not give a penny for the ordinary College graduate" says Edison. "An educated man is not one whose memory is trained to carry a few dates in historyo he is one who can accomplish things. A man who cannot think is not an educated man however many College degrees he may have acquired" (Henry Ford). By a curious coincidence almost at the moment I was writing these lines, my eyes accidentally caught the telegram conveying the notable pronouncement by Mr. Morris who has been called the "Ford of England": "For business a University training is an absolute waste of time. Though there are exceptions, I never found a University training any use to my organization. The University won't confer the qualities essential to Commerce, but obliterates them if originally present. It does not give an understanding of the Workers' psychology which is essential to carrying on large scale business. They absorb the idea that life is an easy thing and pay too great attention to sport and pleasure."</p>
		<p>My intimate connection with several industries in Bengal for the last 30 years and more has given me a rude shock and sad experience in this respect, as far as University products are concerned.</p>
		<p>My audience, I am afraid, is getting a bit nervous as being invited to address a convocation of graduates, it may be thought that I have been utilizing this opportunity to preach a sermon against University education altogether. Nothing is further from my purpose. My object is to sound a note of warning against the feverish craze in our young men to secure a degree, and the same to those Universities themselves who would lose sight of their highest ideals. I have already pleaded for a considerable elimination in the process of selection. No one should choose a University career unless he feels that he has an instinctive and internal vocation for it. A University should be a centre of scholarship, research and culture. Let those seek the portals of the academy who are prepared to dedicate their lives at the altar of Saraswati, the Goddess of Learning. It has been my happy lot to enjoy the hospitality of a good number﻿ of colleges in the United Kingdom on two occasions as a delegate of my University to the Congress of the Universities of the Empire. What struck me most on each of those occasions was the richness of their products and our own poverty. Colleges of Cambridge or Oxford are reminiscent of the memory of the great men who shed lustre on their land; they have produced poets, orators, statesmen and men of science. A fellowship at one of these great seminaries of learning has enabled many a poor scholar to cultivate literature or science. If Trinity College, Cambridge, can boast of a Newton, she can equally claim one of the greatest of the men of letters-Macaulay-as her own. A University should be a focus radiating effulgence of learning and wisdom.</p>
		<p>I tremble with joy when I think of the mighty service which University and well-guided education could offer to the nation in the course of a single generation, and my optimism soars even so high as to predict that with increased understanding of the power of knowledge, it would be possible to combat and banish disease, enliven all homes by prosperity and raise the human species to a much nobler height of intelligence. In this goal, think what part a University plays! In the words of Bertrand Russell, "All great art and all great science spring from the passionate desire to embody what was at first an unsubstantial phantom, a beckoning beauty luring men away from safety and ease to a glorious torment. The men in whom this passion exists must not be fettered by the shackles of a utilitarian philosophy, for to their ardour we owe all that makes man great." This is the function of a University.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the<br /> University of Mysore,<br /> on the 3rd November 1927, by<br /> Sir Jagadis Chandra Bose,<br /> Kt., C.S.I., C.I.E., M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S.</h1>
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>When I received His Highness the Chancellor's gracious invitation, I realized anew the unity of intellectual life of India and its continuity from the most ancient times. His Highness' kind thought in asking me to deliver the Convocation Address has probably been prompted by sympathy and appreciation of my efforts, now extending over more than a third of a century, to revive in some measure the great intellectual traditions of this great country. Many years ago I chose teaching not as a profession, but as the highest vocation. I could think of nothing higher than consecrating my life to the guidance of the young with their dreams and aspirations yet unfulfilled and in helping them in the attainment of manhood. I see before me young students going out in life's great adventure. What is to be the guiding principle that is to stand by you and inspire you even in days of despondency? There never came a time so fateful as the present when a great demand is made on the strength and idealism of our youth in serving the highest interest of the country. I will﻿ not, therefore, appeal to your weakness but to your strength; I would not care to set before you what is easy but use all compulsion for your choice of the most difficult. You are seekers after truth; I will tell you of the discipline through which you must pass for the discovery of truth. In this the heritage of the past will help you; but you are not to be a mere slave of the past but the true inheritors of its wisdom.</p>
		<p>I was paralysed at the beginning of my life by various hypnotic suggestions that India was only interesting because of metaphysical speculations of her ancient dreamers, and that the greatness of the country was past and never to be revived again.</p>
		<p>You may ask who taught me better, what was the stimulus that enabled me to shake off the lethargy of despair? My answer is that my own work was my teacher, that strokes of repeated adversity served as the requisite stimulus, and that the lessons of the past have been my abiding inspiration. I fully realized that there can be no true revival except through the awakening of all that had been conserved in the national life by inheritance and culture. Such an awakening will be the release of a giant force, hitherto held latent, for dynamic expression in the great Indian renaissance. The stimulus for this must come from within, the portent of which is found in the quickened national consciousness.</p>
		<p>In my address this morning I will not speak of anything that is impossible of attainment or of things that have been accomplished only in other countries, but what can be done or has been done in India. I have been, and am still a student; your struggles and difficulties have also been mine. In your hours of despondency it may perhaps help you to know that not even a glimmer of success ever came to remove the gloom except after years of persisent struggle. I held the belief that it is not for man to complain of circumstances, but bravely to accept, to confront and dominate over them. I know that what has been done before will be accomplished again and that the past was not to remain merely as a dream.</p>
		<p>I spoke of my Work itself being my teacher. The illumination came to me only after years of unremitting pursuit after truth. It was this that enabled me, through rigid scientific methods, to establish the great generalization of the Unity of Life and to realize fully all its implications. I will tell you what I was able to decipher in the book of life itself, of conditions which exalt the highest manifestations of life.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Life of the Tree</strong></p>
		<p>The tree may be likened to a State consisting of countless living units, different groups of which co-operate in the discharge of definite functions for the advantage of the community; any disharmony in the organism means the destruction of the commonwealth. The tree persists because it is rooted deeply in its own soil which provides its proper nourishment and endows it with Strength in﻿ struggling against all dangers that threaten it. The shocks from outside had never been able to overpower it, but only called forth its nascent power of resistance. It had met change by counterchange; the decaying and the effete had been cast off as wom leaves, and changing times called forth its power of readjustment. Its racial memory had also been a source of great additional strength; every particle of the embryo within the seed may thus bear the impress of the mighty banian tree. What then is the strength that confers on the tree its great power of endurance? It is the strength derived from the place of its birth, its perception and quick readjustment to change, and its inherited memory of the past. The efflorescence of life is then the supreme gift of the place and its associations. Isolated from these what fate awaits the poor wretch nurtured in alien thought and ways? Death dogs his footsteps, and annihilation is the inevitable end.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>A National University</strong></p>
		<p>The highest expression in the life of a nation must be its intellectual eminence and its power of enriching the world by advancing the frontiers of knowledge. When a nation has lost this power, when it merely receives and has nothing to give, then its healthy life is over and it sinks into a degenerate existence which is purely parasitic. The status of a great University cannot be secured by any artificial means, nor can any charter assure it. Its world status is only to be won by the intrinsic value﻿ of great contribution made by its scholars. To be organic and vital, our national university must stand primarily for self-expression and winning for India her true place among the federation of nations.</p>
		<p>Critics have denied India's capacity for advancement of knowledge and spread of learning among her people. It has been urged that there is no true democratic spirit, that there could be no real contact between her diverse peoples, and no continuity between the past and the present; that there is an intolerant theocratic spirit which insisted on an acceptance of authority in place of dictates of reason; that the people of India because of their speculative bent are incapable of advancing positive knowledge; and that the exact method of science being Western is alien to national culture. These assertions are as ignorant as they are baseless.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Democratic Spirit</strong></p>
		<p>I do not know of any other country of the world, except ancient India, where sons of kings and commoners were required to live a life of simplicity and perfect equality under a great teacher. In our great epic we read of a great tournament that was held before the court of Hastinapura more than thirty centuries ago. Karna, the reputed son of a charioteer, had challenged the supremacy of Prince Arjuna. To this challenge Arjuna had returned a scornful answer: "A prince could not cross swords with one who could claim no nobility of descent." "I am my﻿ own ancestor," replied Kama, "and my deeds are my patents of nobility." This is perhaps the earliest assertion of the right of man to choose and determine his destiny. Tuming to recent times my father insisted on my attending the Vernacular instead of the more fashionable English School. This brought me in friendly contact with sons of toilers, those who tilled the ground and made the land blossom with green verdure and ripening com, and the sons of fisher folks who told of strange creatures that frequented mighty rivers. From them I derived my passionate love of nature. I learnt to think in my own language and receive through Indian epics the heritage of our national culture. I also came to realize the ideals of our ancient State, of a Vikramaditya and his Court, which was never regarded as complete without the "nine gems" which represented different branches of learning. The people offered homage to the State not because it was panoplied by mere physical force, but because it aspired to make more enduring conquests in the realm of mind and spirit.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Continuity of Intellectual Life in India</strong></p>
		<p>In regard to the spread of leaming geographical barriers have never in the past offered any obstacle to the intellectual communion among the different peoples of India. The vision of the past rises vividly before us, and we behold a great procession of immortals who still live and inspire us. We see Sankaracharya acclaimed everywhere during his march of intellectual conquest of﻿ all countries from the south to the extreme north. We see the scholars of Bengal with a few palm leaf manuscripts as their sole treasure, crossing the Himalayan barrier, inspired by love and service, to carry Indian lore to Tibet, to China and to the further East. The great intellectual movements were never confined to any particular province, for the torch of learning was kept lighted for many centuries in her different universities. And it was the fame of a great teacher that drew scholers from even the most distant corners of India. The traditions of the past have not been lost, for even to-day leaders of thought from different provinces travel from one end of the country to the other, thus keeping alive the bond of unity and closest kinship. Those who have read history aright realize the great assimilative power of Indian civilization by which many races and peoples came to regard this great country as their home. And it is by their joint efforts that will be built the Greater India yet to be.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Freedom of Inquiry</strong></p>
		<p>It is perfectly true that nothing could be so detrimental to the furtherance of truth than a narrow theocratic bias and intolerance in accepting new facts and doctrines that run counter to narrow orthodoxy. One is, however, constrained to say that this narrow spirit is more in evidence in the West than in the East. Galileo's recantation under compulsion and Bruno's being burnt at the stake are facts well known. The spirit of intolerance is still alive as exemplified﻿ by the bitter controversy that has recently arisen regarding the Darwinian theory, and the penalizing of the teaching of evolution in a certain State of progressive America. There is a priesthood even in science, and it is notorious how seldom a great discovery finds appreciation during the life of its author.</p>
		<p>In regard to the question whether theocratic bias obstructed free pursuit of inquiry in this country, the fact is well known that two schools of thought flourished here side by side, one of which relied on faith and was supported by estalished authority. The other based itself on pure reason and refused to accept anything which could not be substantiated by objective proof.</p>
		<p>No false claim should, however, be made that our ancestors were omniscient and that no further advance of knowledge was possible. What they attained was through unremitting efforts in building the edifice of knowledge step by step. Even after all they had achieved they had the greatness to declare that even the Vedas are to be rejected if these do not conform to truth. It is false patriotism that would claim credit for anything less vital than the supreme gift of freedom of inquiry that had been bequeathed to us.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>India's Contributions in the Past</strong></p>
		<p>Nothing can be more vulgar or more untrue than the ignorant assertion that the world owes its progress of knowledge to any particular race. The whole world﻿ is interdependent and a constant stream of thought has throughout ages enriched the common heritage of mankind. It is the realization of this mutual dependence that has kept the mighty fabric bound together and ensured the continuity and permanence of civilization.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless ignorant assertions have been made that advance of Science and State-craft are entirely due to the contributions of the West. It must be a matter of high gratification to the Mysore State that two of its distinguished officers should have, by their patient labours, succeeded in lifting the veil that shrouded the past. The pioneer work on the Positive Sciences of the Ancient Hindus has been the result of vast erudition of the Vice-Chancellor of this University. No less important is the remarkable contribution of Dr. R. Shama Sastry whose patient and ardent scholarship has brought to light Kautilya's Arthasastro.</p>
		<p>Can we, however, remain satisfied only with the traditions of the past? Critics have told us time after time that whatever the past might have been, there is now no strength left for the renewal of our national life. They point out that while success in our national efforts have been few and far between, the failures have been far too many. But failure is only transient, while success Awaits for us round, the last corner. It is the obvious and the blatant that blinds us to the essential. Few realize the great urge hidden to the eyes of men, that is moving the great mass of the people in their ceaseless efforts to realize some common aspiration. Where lies the secret﻿  of that potency which makes certain efforts apparently doomed to failure, rise renewed from beneath smouldering ashes? When we look deeper we shall find that as inevitable as is the sequence of cause and effect, so unrelenting must be the sequence of failure and success. We shall find that failure must be the antecedent power to lie dormant for the long subsequent dynamic expression which is accliamed as success.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>India's Contribution in<br /> Advancement of Modern Science</strong></p>
		<p>Although science is neither of the East nor of the West but international in its universality, yet India by her habit of mind and inherited gifts handed down from generation to generation is specially fitted to make great contributions in furtherance of knowledge. The burning Indian imagination which can extort new order out of a mass of apparently contradictory facts can also be held in check by the habit of concentration, it is this restraint which confers the power to hold the mind in pursuit of truth in infinite patience.</p>
		<p>Two different methods are essential for the discovery of truth, the method of introspection and the method of experimental verification. Aimless experimentation seldom leads to any great result, while unrestrained imagination leads to wildest speculation subversive of all intellectual sanity. The two methods must therefore be equally balanced, one supplementing the other.﻿</p>
		<p>The real difficulty that thwarts the investigator of life as exemplified by plants arises from the fact that the interplay of life-action is taking place within the dark profundities of the interior of the tree which our eyes cannot fathom. As the first step to discover the hidden mechanism of the tree, one has to become the tree and feel the pulse-beat of its throbbing life. Next, in order to reveal the intricate mechanism of its life, it is necessary to gain access to the smallest unit of life, the "life atom", and succeed in recording its throbbing pulsation. For this it was necessary to invent instruments of surpassing accuracy and sensitiveness. The invention of the microscope magnifying only a few thousand times initiated a new era in advance of biological science. The Magnetic Crescograph magnifying fifty million times is now revealing the wonders of a new world, the plant itself being made to reveal the secrets of its inner life. Even in this path of selfrestraint and verification, the inquirer is making for a region of surpassing wonder. When visible light ends, he still follows the invisible. When the note of the audible raches the unheard, even then he gathers the tremulous message. A new world opens out to him beyond our conceiving, the vast world of inarticulate life, which suffers and struggles even as ourselves. Is it less of a miracle that man undismayed by the imperfection of his senses should yet build himself a raft of thought to make daring adventures in uncharted seas! And in his voyage of discovery he catches an occasional glimpse of the ineffable wonder﻿ that had hitherto been hidden from his view. That vision crushes out of him all self-sufficiency, all that kept him unconscious of the great pulse that beats through the universe. It was by the combination of the introspective and the highly advanced experimental methods that it was possible to establish the Unity of Life; the barrier that divided kindred phenomena vanished, the plant and animal being found as a multiple unity in a single ocean of being.</p>
		<p>The new results are so revolutionary in their implications upon the older theories regarding the functioning of plant life, that there was controversy in 1920 as to the reliability of the indications of my super-magnifying instruments. An enquiry was, therefore, undertaken by a Committee of leading Fellows of the Royal Society including Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Bragg the famous physicists, Sir Willam Bayless the animal physiologist, Professor Oliver and Blackman the plant-physiologists, and Professor Donnan the chemist. They reported as the results of various tests, that the crescograph correctly recorded growth and the actual response of living tissues to stimulus. It is worth noting that these and other extraordinary sensitive instruments were all constructed by Indian mechanicians trained in my Institute. It is necessary to lay special stress on this point at this juncture when the assertion totally ignorant and unfounded is made that lack of faculty of discovery and invention renders this country incapable of making any great industrial advance.﻿</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Control of the Mind</strong></p>
		<p>These wonders became revealed to me only after years of struggle in overcoming difficulties which at first appeared as almost insurmountable. It was the Indian habit of concentration that led ultimately to the overcoming of all difficulties. It is no easy life that lies before an investigator. He has to steel his body and mind to the utmost and prepare for a life of unending struggle. Even after all this there is no assurance whatever of success to reward him for his ceaseless toil. He has to cast his life as an offering, regarding gain and loss, success and failure, as one. But the lure that draws heroic souls is not success that can be easily achieved, but defeat and tribulation in the pursuit of the unattainable.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Utility</strong></p>
		<p>I have often been asked: what could be the practical use of these researches on the recondite phenomena of the life of plants? A similar question was also asked when so far back as 1894, I succeeded in transmitting energy by wireless electric waves for starting machinery at a distance and exploding a disant mine. The invention of the galena receiver in my laboratory also solved the difficulty of long-distance transmission. All this was regarded at the time as a mere scientific curiosity.</p>
		<p>Regarding the practical applications of discoveries in plant life, researches on growth have been rendered﻿ possible by the invention of the High Magnification Crescograph. The laws of growth are now being discovered, a knowledge of which is essential for any real advance in practical agriculture. Another important advance has been made by the discovery of identical reaction of various drugs on plant and on animal life. This has led to investigations on the action of extracts from various Indian plants, the medicinal properties of which had not hitherto been suspected, and by the employment of which the heart machine can be regulated and rendered highly efficient. The newly invented Resonant Cardiograph inscribes the different phases of the heartbeat with wonderful minuteness and reveals the specific action of different plant-extracts in reviving the activity of the heart in a state of depression. From the results of these investigations, an entirely new arsenal of medicine obtained from Indian plants will be available for the relief of humanity.</p>
		<p>An altogether different line of advance has also been made in regard to the tracing of gradual evolution of nervous system from the simplest to the most complex. In the simpler vegetable life, where lies the plant-psyche, the faint copy of our consciousness? A nervous structure I have been able to discover in the plant, the characteristic reactions of which are likely to lead to the better understanding of the parallel phenomena in our own psychic life. A plant carefully protected under glass from the stimulating blows of the environment looks flourishing but in reality it is flabby and decadent, its highest nervous function having remained undeveloped. But when the same plant is exposed to the rough shocks of the environment, then its nervous structure becomes fully developed. In human life also, it is not cotton-wool protection but blows of adversity that evolve true manhood.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Indian Initiative in Matters Educational</strong></p>
		<p>I had occasion recently to take part at the great International Conference on Education held at Locarno. They realized that the old system hitherto in vogue was quite antiquated and the new initiative must be taken in methods of education. The imported method hitherto in vogue is quite out of date and must therefore be modified and made a living force for the wakening of national aspiration and efficiency. A system which holds forth no other hope but perpetual tutelage cannot but be deadening. Nothing could be more humiliating than the position of Indian students in Europe, a situation which for many reasons is full of danger. Why should we not aspire to found great centres of learning? It was this idea which led to the foundation of my Institute ten years ago by which I hoped to revive the great traditions of our country, which, many centuries ago, attracted scholars from all parts of the world, within the precincts of its ancient seats of learning, at Nalanda and Taxila. That dream of mine has now been amply fulfilled. May I not hope that what has been accomplished would be carried out with even greater power by this enlightened State? You must however, be inspired by as﻿ indomitable a faith. In justification of that faith it was necessary to indicate briefly what was accomplished by Indian initiative and by Indian scholars.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Economic Peril</strong></p>
		<p>Increasing unemployment and severe economic distress is the cause of unrest here as in other parts of the world; only on account of its magnitude the problem is far more acute here. It is hunger that drives people to desperation and to the destruction of all that has been built up for ordered progress. It is tragic that our own country with its great potential wealth and possibilities of industrial development should be in this plight. All efforts have been long paralysed by assertions, as ignorant as they are unfounded, that this country is incapable of producing great discoverers and inventors. These assertions have now been completely disproved.</p>
		<p>In other parts of the world, it is the best intelleet of the country and the leading men of business- who are called to devise means for increasing the wealth of the country. In my travels I found little or no distress in small countries such as Norway and Denmark, countries which are in no sense rich in natural wealth. Nevertheless they have their system of universal education and the most up-to-date university. Poverty is pratically unknown. The miracle is accomplished through science by utilizing to the utmost all the available resources of the country. Could we not take to heart the lesson thus taught? There﻿ are now a very large number of young men who could be specially trained in efficiently conducted institutes, the standard of which should bear comparison with any in the world. It should be also our aim not to be so entirely dependent on foreign countries for our higher education and for our needs. For carrying out such a programme, a far-sighted State policy is urgently required. But there is a strange general apathy on this question. It is a matter of much gratification and pride to us to know that the State of Mysore has given its most serious attention to this subject.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>A Vicious Circle</strong></p>
		<p>When man beheld spread before him the earth, the sea and the air, he went forth in his great adventures. He rode the tumultuous sea and circled the globe. The challenge of the sky he accepted and by his daring spirit conquered it and established an unobstructed highway. Man is a creative being and these miracles attest to his godlike and indomitable spirit. But the weakling, who has forgotten the divinity that is in him, leads an ignoble life of passivity. He alone who has striven and won can enrich the world by giving away the fruits of his victorious experience.</p>
		<p>A strange weakness and passivity has entered into the life of the people, and unless the evil is remedied, the end is inevitable. Nature shows no mercy to the feeble and the decadent. The vicious circle lies in this: the lazy is content with earning what is barely sufficient﻿ to maintain life itself; the evil increases at a compound rate, reducing further the capacity for work, and also the power of resistance to ills that beset life ending in the lowering of scale of human life, starvation and death. In other countries, even under stress of great national disaster, the human efficiency has remained unimpaired due to the joint efforts of the people and the State in building up national prosperity.</p>
		<p>There is a special need for an enlightened policy in regard to the shaping of the post-graduate career of the most distinguished students of the university. Many of my old students showed special aptitude in science; but as there was no scientific career open for them, they were compelled against their natural inclination to choose the profession of law. None but the intentionally blind can fail to realize the crisis to which things are tending in a country where distress is so widespread and where the only scope for intellect is the pursuit of tortuous and uncertain course of the law courts.</p>
		<p>In contrast to this, I had the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the solicitude with which the Government of Japan follow the career of her promising students whom they regard as the greatest asset for the advancement of their country. I found them personally known at headquarters, and arrangements made through Japanese Consuls in Europe and America, so that in the course of two years they go through a very special training under the most distinguished specialists to make them﻿ efficient in their subjects. They do not find themselves stranded on their return, for arrangements had already been made by their Government so that their intellect and training find the fullest scope in the service of the State.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Ideal of a Model Indian State</strong></p>
		<p>This leads me to the ideal held by this State which found practical expression in the establishment of the national university and in many enterprises for the welfare of the people. The university and the industrial enterprises cannot be dissociated from each other but must be regarded as complementary activities for the common good of the State. There are other countries more fortunate which can shower their millions on a particular department of learning. We have. no millions to spare and have therefore to utilize to the utmost the available resources. But is this to deter us, is the mind of man with his indomitable spirit of no account?</p>
		<p>What could be the reason of the high efficiency in administration of this State? Is it because the Ministers are in close touch with the people realizing their prosperity redounding to the credit of the State? It is worth enquiry how some of the greatest Indian administrators found full opportunity for the expansion of their genius in the premier States of India. The genius of Sir K. Seshadri foresaw the great possibilities for utilization of undeveloped resources of Mysore; his abounding energy found﻿ proper scope in great schemes for irrigation and in the electric trapping of power that had hitherto run to waste. Who can truly appraise the value of these achievements or measure the stimulus given to young minds trained in this University for the unique opportunity offered for the highest development of their latent powers? Industry and research will act and react on each other to the lasting benefit of both. To Sir M. Visvesvaraya, another Minister of this State, is due the credit of Bhadravati Iron Works. In this state men are not mere dreamers, but they have the strength and persistence to see their vision realized. What could be the source of their inspiration? Is it the love of the country and loyalty to an ideal State which had nerved them to supreme efforts?</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Teaching and Research</strong></p>
		<p>Teaching and research are indissolubly connected with each other. The spirit of research cannot be imparted by mere lectures on antiquated theories which are often entirely baseless and which effectively block all further progress. Nothing can be so destructive of originality as blind acceptance of ex-cathedra statements. The true function of a great teacher is to train his disciples to discover things themselves. Such a teacher cannot be easily found and it will be the duty of the university to discover him and give him every facility for his work. Let there be no creation of a learned caste whose attention is mainly﻿ taken up in securing special privileges. It is only from a burning candle that others could be lighted. The pupils by working under such a teacher will learn the value of persistence and of the infinite care to be taken at every step; they will catch from him glimpses of inspiration by which he succeeds in wresting from Nature her most jealously guarded secrets. They will become a part of his being and will hand down a passionate love of truth through fieeting generaions. That spirit can never die; we shall pass away, and even kingdoms may disappear. Truth alone will survive, for it is eternal.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Injunction to Students</strong></p>
		<p>What is to be my message to young students with whom I am brought in touch to-day? Could I wish for you anything less than that you should attain the highestmanhood or womanhood? May you realize the great privilege of being born at a time when your country needed you most! The civilziation we have inherited has lasted through many millenniums; you will certainly not allow it to be destroyed through weakness or passivity. You will answer to this call that has been echoing through ages, the call which compels men and women to choose a life of unending struggle for the alleviation of human suffering. The removal of suffering and the cause of suffering is the Dharma of a Kshatriya. Be each of you a true Kshatriya!</p>
		<p>It was action and not weak passivity that was glorified in heroic India of the past and the greatest illumination came even in the field of battle. There can be no happiness for any of us, unless it has been won for all. In this I would urge on you the doctrine of strength and of undying hope. Realize that there is something with Indian culture which is possessed of extraordinary latent strength by which it has resisted the ravages of time and destructive changes that have swept over the earth. And indeed a capacity to endure must be innate in that mighty civilization which has seen the intellectual culture of Nile Valley, of Assyria and of Babylonia wax, wane and disappear, and which to-day gazes on the future with the same invincible faith with which it get the past.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation of the University of Mysore, on the 23rd August 1928, by C.R. Reddy, Esq., M.A. (Cantab.), Bar-at-Law, Vice-Chancellor, Andhra University</h1>
		<p><strong>GRADUATES,</strong></p>
		<p>I owe it to the courtesy of His Highness the Chancellor and other academic authorities of your University that I have the honour to participate in this auspicious function. They have shown me rare consideration for which I am profoundly grateful.</p>
		<p>Seven years ago, under troubled feelings, I relinquished the privilege of belonging to the Mysore Service. But as my love for Mysore has known no abatement nor will know any, I rejoice to be back here in this happier hour. But the happiness of my home-coming is marred by the absence of my Bhai Saheb, as I used to call him, Mr. Humza Hussain, than whom I have not come across a more gracious or truer soul in all my varied sojourn through life. His courtesy, his urbanity, his loyal devotion to friends, his unswerving sense of duty, his unselfish and therefore bright, illuminating outlook on life, and energetic sympathy for the suffering, struggling masses in Mysore, are fast becoming, with lapse of time, twilight memories; and alas, I can no longer enjoy the effulgence of the living sun. Death has also robbed me of the friendly greetings of Professor Srinivasa Rao of the Central College. On his return from America I did my little best to secure for him an adequate position, knowing how much salaried status counts in our bureaucratic atmosphere. And his career, so full of scientific promise and of inspiring popularity with the students, has been cut off in its prime. The sickle has mowed before the corn was ripe; yet man may not question or complain, but must bow his head in humble resignation.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Depressed Classes Advancement Trust</strong></p>
		<p>I am afraid I am falling into a reminiscential mood, which is but natural at family reunions. But as a reminiscent mood has no conscience for the time it consumes or the audience it bores, I had better avoid the unavailing retrospect and turn to living themes. Every Indian is proud of the continuous and untiring progress made by Mysore in every direction and of the ceaseless vigilance with which public interests are promoted. The dynamic impulse imparted by Sir M. Visvesvaraya, who effected a rapid and fruitful revolution in the functions of Government, seems to be operating with undiminished, and I trust, more circumspect force. I can think only of one oversight. The scheme for a Depressed Classes Advancement Trust that I had the pleasure to propound has not yet materialized. I should not have mentioned this but for the fact that every one, not excluding the Government of the day, gave it an enthusiastic welcome. But perhaps as a publicist I﻿ ought to have known that where there is unanimity of sentiment, there is hardly incentive enough for any particular person or set of persons to act, and the will is dissolved in unctious wish. Platitudes are never so effective as contentious truths; they do not give rise to sufficient friction for the generation of motive power.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>University Organization</strong></p>
		<p>Speech is or should be action. The action in which I am now engaged with the generous co-operation of the Andhra academic authorities is University Organization. And I am further impelled to deal with this subject by the irresistible attraction of the grand educational reconstruction adopted within the last two years by Mysore under the guidance of your famous Vice-Chancellor. It is one of the biggest achievements in Indian educational history; and it is bound to influence other Universities in no small degree.</p>
		<p>I have read again and again the great speech in which Sir Brajendranath Seal introduced the new scheme in the Senate explaining its scope and how it was correlated with the psychology of our people and the needs of Mysore. It is a document in which constructive educational schemes have been thought out in every part and detail in terms of our life and conditions. To praise Sir Brajendranath Seal must sound like impertinence on my part. But that will not deter me from saying that in my humble judgement his speech deserves to rank with the greatest documents of our educational history.﻿</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Favourable Situation in Mysore</strong></p>
		<p>In relation to University Organization Mysore has been exceptionally fortunate in at least two respects. You have a teaching University with a stable staff, immune from mercurial fluctuations of function and locality. And your Government is anxious to operate it in the closest possible co-ordination with its other departments of State, such as Industries, Railways, Public Works, Commerce, Banking and all the range of its administration and economic enterprises. The University is not regarded as an interloper, and having created a University, they have not left it at a foundlings' hospital as their highest act of statesmanship, and liberally consigned it to thrive on private charity. No wonder then that in its organization on the side of substantial education and the amplitude of its activities, the Mysore University is advancing and extending with a speed and momentum that breaks my heart with envy, though as an old Mysorean I allow my humanity to prevail and rejoice unboundedly. Many faculties have been added, still more are in the process of being added; provision has been made at the different grades for vocational, industrial, technical and technological training and education; archaeology and history have been brought together under one roof; the critical and scientific study of Oriental Cultures and Indology have been provided for; the Entrance and First Year Examinations have been abolished to my entire, though belated, satisfaction, and in every way justice has been done to the essentials of an oecumenical University﻿ which is my word for Dr. Seal's International-without, neglecting regional needs.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Oecumenical and Regional Types</strong></p>
		<p>But indeed I fail to see how the two types could be entirely separated and whether there are two types at all anywhere instead of a compositas one everywhere. Perhaps it is a difference of degree and not of kind. Regional elements may be found at Oxford itself, let alone Cambridge. The medium of education is English-a regional language; they don't neglect English History and Politics, and since the War, applied sciences are receiving increasing attention. Nor is Leeds, which on all accounts rendered the largest amount of national service during the Great War, without its elements of universality. Its woollen, leather and Printing departments attract students from all parts of the world. The present Superintendent of your Government Press underwent, I believe, much of his training in Leeds. Even applied science is science and there cannot be a particular which does not imply a universal.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The State in Relation to the University,</strong></p>
		<p>But the regional idea is of inestimable value in -India from another and more practical aspect. It suggests with compendious clearness the relations that ought to subsist between the State and the University. No adaptation of a University to regional requirements is possible, unless﻿ Government, which is the largest employer of labour in India, actively encourages and promotes such an adaptation and is willing to use the University as its chief depot for supplying the human power required in all its departments and enterprises, as is done by every nation-state in the world. Government would then not merely help to lessen educated unemployment but would provide itself with an adequate motive for financing the University in order to enable it to maintain the highest world standards in all its departments and advance in the van of discovery and invention. When its own graduates are not wanted and overlooked, how is progress, material or moral, possible? Electrical, Railway, Mining, Marine and other forms of Engineering, etc., ought to be cultivated in India and to the highest degree possible, but then the State should not starve its own men in the name of an efficiency that it will not promote. Nor will throwing open this place or that place with fractional, niggardly hand meet the needs of University Organization. We cannot organize courses for one man or two. We must admit as many as we can, consistently with efficiency of teaching and practical works; otherwise the facilities in Professors and Laboratories that we provide will not be utilized to the full. Let me quote what I said on another occasion, as I consider this point to be one of the vital elements of the regional idea:</p>
		<p>"National efficiency would require the organization of Engineering and other technological courses. But even here Government policy is a big factor, and Governinent﻿ may either accelerate or retard progress by the manner in which it provides openings in its technical departments for our qualified people. Still, the University can do its duty. As regards the argument that Government can't provide places for everyone, I consider it to be sound as far as it goes. But surely Government can do much to promote industry and commerce, and is itself the biggest industrial factor in India, and therefore its action is decisive even as regards the development of commerce and industry by private enterprise and the openings thus made available for Indians. Government need not create places for our qualified men; if it fills such places as there are with them, that will suffice.</p>
		<p>"What I wish to emphasize is that Education and University are inextricably mixed up with society on the one hand and Government on the other, and cannot be regarded as factors which can function and produce results in isolation and abstraction."</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Univeristy Autonomy</strong></p>
		<p>Though thus the State should foster the University by providing adequate careers within the extent possible in its organization and by the general development of the country as well as adequate funds, it should not. convert either by law or administrative or financial pressure the University into a department of the State.</p>
		<p>All the world over collegiate and higher education is organized almost without exception by Universities, though﻿ most of the modern Universities depend almost entirely on Government for their support. To create a University and then to treat it as a body to be either starved or - enslaved appears to me to be what Euclid so eloquently. styles <em>reductio ad absurdum..</em> The reason why Universities are financed by the State and allowed the fullest autonomy is that world experience extending over centuries has proved conclusively that such an agency is better fitted to carry out the mission of higher culture and research than a department of the State. The finest academic growths are not possible under the shadow of bureaucratic authority. As Lord Bryce put it:</p>
		<p>"Freedom is the life-blood of University teaching. Neither the political opinions of a professor, nor the character of the economic doctrines which he holds and propagates ought to be a ground for appointing or dismissing him, nor ought he to be any less free to speak and vote as he pleases than any other citizen. And though it is right and fitting that the State should be represented in the governing authority of a University which it supports, experience seems to have proved that both the educational policy and the daily administration and discipline of a University ought, as far as possible, to be either left in academic hands or entrusted to an authority on which the academic element predominates."</p>
		<p>Lord Balfour speaking more recently thus declared:-</p>
		<p>"If the State be asked to subscribe great funds, either in this country or in any of the Dominions or indeed in any country, there will always be a natural and pardonable instinct on the part of the State to control and supervise the working of an institution which it is doing so much to support. <em>It is perfectly natural but it is extremely dangerous.</em> Cambridge, Oxford and the old Universities are receiving assistance from the State, but our University traditions are so deeply rooted that I do not think there is any symptom, as far as my judgement goes, of any Government attempting to interfere with the University. <em>University autonomy, whether it be well exercised or ill exercised, is at all events at the worst far better than State control."</em> (The italics are mine.)</p>
		<p>I notice that in Mysore th: Senate has been engaged in an invasion of the Syndicate and I wish the expedition every success. I hope the day is not far distant when the University staff will be omitted from the Civil List as being out of place.</p>
		<p>The psychology of some of our Governments is at times baffling. They can't trust local bodies with power because there are not enough educated members on them. They won't trust the Universities because they have none but educated persons on them. The only category they confide in, is the Secretariat, which not infrequently functions in an atmosphere of transcendental authority mightily elevated above the reach of reason and criticism. If consistently benevolent and uniformly wise, bureaucratic absolutism may possibly make a people fat but it can never make them strong. And the weakness of the people is bound to Tesult sooner or later in governmental debility.﻿</p>
		<p>But the transformation of the Mysore University into an autonomous corporation does not appear to me to be a simple process. It would involve a revision of the constitution in many respects including the system of elections now in vogue. As a way out of the dilemmas presented by the opposing considerations of liberty and prudence including the necessity for securing a predominant position to the academic element, a more complex and balanced type of constitution like the one originally recommended by some of us when the University was being founded, may, after all, have to be adopted with the changes shown to be necessary by subsequent experience.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Andhra Autonomy</strong></p>
		<p>If Mysore excels in educational content the Andhra University may legitimately claim to have the better academic form, thanks to the generous statesmanship of the last Ministryand the Legislative Council. It is easily and by far the most autonomous corporation of its kind in India. Only two are nominated, and that too by the Chancellor-which in practice is a real distinction from the Governor to the Syndicate. And the nominations to the Senate do not exceed twelve, and these again are made by the Chancellor. The University has full control of educational regulation and all appointments in the University are entirely within the competence of the University authorities. If only this outburst of confidence in the Andhra genius to administer a University had been accompanied by an﻿ equally magnanimous financial confidence in its capacity to spend economically and efficiently by the adoption of the system of block grants and by the transfer of Government Colleges as contemplated in the Act, so that the Teaching University intended by Government might be realized, the Andhras too would have attempted constructive educational policies. But the headquarters problem blocks the way.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Vernacular Medium</strong></p>
		<p>It is with no small hestation and nervousness that I venture to remark that the very essence of the regional idea is education as far as possible through the vernacular. I don't belittle the importance of the oecumenical or international ideal. I dismiss the oecumenical as impossible of achievement in this respect, because there is as yet no universal language. And the international pre-supposes that we should be nation first and take part in worldexchanges of thought and culture as an equal. Thus both the international and the regional ideas involve instruction through Kannada. Mysore here again is fortunate to a degree that will not be possible in British India until provinces are reconstituted on a linguistic basis. Mysore is almost unitary in its language, for the Telugu that you have in your Eastern districts is twin sister to Kannada with indistinguishable lineaments. Nor is there any need or necessity for having an official language different from the people's. But we lack self-confidence on this subject. In theory we all agree that it is easier﻿ to master and spread knowledge by employing a natural instead of a foreign medium. But we are afraid of impairing the estimation in which our educational efficiency is held by others. It seems so easy to borrow the ready-made clothing of Eruope; so difficult to produce the raiment ourselves. We seem to lack the imaginative power to view. things in the growth. And we are obsessed by the possible discount to which our degrees would be subjected. As regards researches and original work, nobody holds that their value would depend on how excellently they are narrated in English or French; and when our Universities put forth a sufficient amount of higher work, the credit that they will thereby achieve will extend to all the degrees they confer. But I don't wish to say more on the theory of vernacularization, which has been discussed threadbare. Only one observation may be repeated. That it need not produce a lowering in the stadard of English and that every care should be taken that English is properly and adequately studied as a language. With this caution I don't see why we should not vernacularize to the utmost possible extent immediately. The Calcutta University Commission was of opinion that up to the Matriculation standard all subjects except English and Mathematics should be taught in the vernacular. Instead of vernacularization by grades, may we not begin vernacularization on a subject basis? May not Indian History, for instance, be taught in Kannada, from the lowest up to the B.A. and M.A: standards?</p>
		<p>Lack of text-books is no doubt a difficulty, but men are more important than books. If the proper lecturers are forthcoming, the lectures will be forthcoming, and the books will automatically jfollow. Professors at Oxford and Cambridge have a working knowledge of a number of European languages, and they are able to base their lectures on world contributions to their line of study. In the same manner those who lecture in Kannada in the University grades might be required to possess a sufficiently good knowledge of English and perhaps one other language, for them to be able to consult with advantage authoritative books written in those languages. The methods of teaching and training prevalent in the great Universities of the West proceed on the view that the mind is a vital growth to be fostered and strengthened and not an emptiness to be mechanically stuffed. They concentrate on the development of faculty and acquisition of knowledge and not on the attainment of a tongue.</p>
		<p>In fairness to the Andhra academic authorities, who are considering this question, I must say that these are my personal opinions which it would be my duty to change if convincing arguments to the contrary are forthcoming. Further, there are some special complications which have to be taken into due account in the Andhra area, namely, correlation with competitive examinations and service conditions and the existence of other vernaculars.﻿</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Women's Education</strong></p>
		<p>The regional idea can't receive its fullest application unless it includes women within its scope. And in view of the very early age at which girls are withdrawn from schools and buridled into matrimony, I don't see how the maximum amount of knowledge could be imparted unless the vernacular medium is employed, even allowing for the natural and superior sharpness of their tongues. If one of the objects of an educational system is to broadcast existing knowledge, to carry it to every household including those in the remotest villages and irrigate our darkness by channels of light, and if it is further conceded that in the conditions in which they are placed, the imparting of the maximum of knowledge in the minimum of time 'to girls is possible only under the regime of the mothertongue, it is a matter for consideration whether India should decide for a differentiation of her media of instruction on a sex basis, making English the medium for boys and the vernacular the medium for girls!</p>
		<p>Women's education deserves to be remodelled. Threre should be no compulsion in the matter, and women wanting to take the general courses prescribed for the boys should be at perfect liberty to do so. But it is a mistake to think that the best possible intellectual training could not be given to women in ways better adpated to their general mode and mission in life.</p>
		<p>During my second European tour Sir Arthur Smithells of Leeds University drew my attention to the King's College﻿ for Women, which provides a three-year course in Household and Social Sciences of a collegiate grade, and qualifies for a degree in the London University; the degree, mind you, which ought to reassure ladies who want to become Bachelors! The art of househoid regulation requires a knowledge and application of a large number of sciences, Physcis, Physiology, Chemistry, Biology, Economics and certain portions of law, to mention a few.</p>
		<p>Household Science is a field still to be organized and explored in India. Mrs. Sidney Webb once remarked to me that we were the most unhygienic nation in regard to food. The poor have little to eat and the rich don't know what to eat and how to prepare or preserve ittoo much ghee, too much sugar, too much spices, too illassorted and ill-conditioned. food, diabetes, and an early break-up of health and strength that has been the routine of Hindu existence.</p>
		<p>There is a vast literature on the values of the foods that Europeans consume. Indian foods remain to be scientifically investigated.</p>
		<p>A woman is also an administrator and domestic economist. She must be able to prepare her domestic budgets with intelligence and forethought.</p>
		<p>In India the widow is too often a helpless dependent and victim of her male relations with no idea of her rights and the laws pertaining to inheritance, division of property, etc., and incapable of defending her interests. Now that political rights are being conferred on women, her development﻿ as person and citizen has to be given due consideration in our curricula. To rescue our sisters from their condition of helpless dependence is a mission that educated India ought no longer to delay.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The State in Relation to Women</strong></p>
		<p>The organization of the State in relation to women's interests and advancement should be planned out boldly and comprehensively. And I know of no State in India that is likely to take up this task in real earnestness and carry it to a chivalrous success, excepting Mysore. A survey should be made of the number of child welfare centres, women's hospitals, primary and middle schools with proper provision for vocational training, institutes for imparting a knowledge of house hold sciences, cottage industries, hygiene, nursing, etc., to the grown-up women, and on that basis the necessary educational and administrative staff and other provisions should be made. Administrative arrangements with special reference to women's needs and progress have not been sufficiently developed in our country. And when developed, they will absorb all the women power that could be produced from our schools and colleges. And they will be absorbed too in ways more natural and healthful to themselves and to society than has been the case till now with the one-sided education they have been getting-an education which does not fit in with the scheme of life of the vast majority of women.</p>
		<p>I am deeply impressed by the methodical manner in which the Missionaries as at Hassan and other centres are not merely imparting book knowledge but building up morale and civilization amongst the lowest of our social orders and raising them to the status of efficient, selfrespecting humanity. If education and government are conceived in some such broad spirit, as charged with the mission of building up life and civilization, the importance of a systematic organization of the State in relation to women will be easily understood.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Women's Enfranchisement</strong></p>
		<p>But women's enfranchisement depends ultimately on two factors, the abolition of early marriages and the granting to them of equal property rights with men. So long as she remains an economic outcaste with no property rights in the parental home and nothing more nourishing of body and mind than a maintenance allowance in the husband's, she can never realize her essential humanity. And where woman is not allowed to be fully human, the mentality of society is bound to be, in some degree at least, inhuman. Giver her the cash and she will obtain the credit for herself !</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Control of Technical Education</strong></p>
		<p>Not infrequently doubts are expressed whether the Vice-Chancellor and the Director of Public Instruction are﻿ the best authorities to be entrusted with the management of vocational, industrial, technical and technological institutions that are now generally conceded as being within the scope of the composite, full-blooded modern educational organizations. I am in favour of keeping them within the purview of the Vice-Chancellor and the Director of Public Instruction. For this reason, management by the Vice-Chancellor in effect means management by the Syndicate on which technical authorities are bound to be represented, and appropriate Faculties and Boards of Studies. Nobody proposes that the Medical College and the Engineering College should be taken out of the jurisdiction of the University.</p>
		<p>As regards the Director of Public Instruction, what with the large number of technical and sectional assistants with whom he has been provided, his administration has in fact become administration by a Board of Education. This machinery may be improved by including on the Board representatives of the technical departments of the State. That co-operation and correlation between the Railway, Industries and other departments and the educational administration is desirable and necessary, nobody will dispute. In the principle of the Board system of administration, which ought to be diligently explored, some way may be found for bringing about more expressly that co-ordination. All things considered, it seems best not to remove industrial and technical education from the highway of the State's educational organization and consign them to﻿ departmental blind alleys, which would impair their popularity and efficiency.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Meical Colleges and the University</strong></p>
		<p>As regards medical education, the following extract from the report of Sir Norman Walker and Colonel Needham is evidence of the superiority of a University organization with its fixed staff of specialists over Government organization with a floating and miscellaneous staff.</p>
		<p>Speaking of the Madras Medical College and Hospitals they say, "The staffs of the College and the Hospitals are provided from the Madras Medical Department; the system is unsatisfactory; it restricts the field of recruitment, and in practice involves too frequent changes in the staffs."</p>
		<p>Speaking of the Vizagapatam Medical College they say, "The training in clinical medicine has been seriously prejudiced by frequent changes in the post of Professors of Medicine ......... The facilities for training in the special departments have not been developed."</p>
		<p>The General Medical Council while dissatisfied with the old state of affairs, appears to be still more apprehensive of inefficiency resulting as a consequence of the Indianization of the I.M.S. and the appointment of more Indians as Professors in the Medical Colleges. It would seem to any fair-minded enquirer that the real sin consists not in the nationality of the teacher but in the defective﻿ organization, perhaps inevitable, under Government management. This aspect has been dealt with in the reply to Sir Norman Walker's criticisms prepared by the Medical Faculty of the Bombay University. They cast the blame on the Governmental system and append statistical tables to prove their point. Not a few men seem to have been appointed as Professors while yet of twenty-six years of age or under. And not a few of the Professors had held as many as six Professorships before they retired. Even in the period between 1900-1910 there have been instances of I.M.S. officers who have held six, five and four Professorships respectively. Pluralism in Professorships seems to have been the rule. Even some of the younger men who were appointed in the period of 1910-1927 as Professors have already held as many as three Professorships; and at this rate before they retire they are likely to box the entire compass of the Medical Chairs going. The Bombay Medical Faculty comments as follows: "When a vacancy arose in one of these Chairs a man had to be found, from amongst the service men, regardless of the fact that none may be available who had special training to fit him for the appointment. The example quoted by Sir Norman on page 5 of Appendix XV "where the fact that a man had passed the primary examination for the F.R.C.S., England, ten years before was regarded as sufficient proof of his capacity to act as Professor of Physiology" emphasizes the fact that this practice still obtains in colleges where the teaching staff has to be found from the service. Such﻿</p>
		<p>mutations (or is it mimicries?) are to be met with in the field of the Indian Educational Service also, though not to anything like the same extent.</p>
		<p>It is impossible to deny that there is some point in Sir Norman Walker's pessimistic outlook. Defective as the old arrangements had been, Indianization without regard to the right system of recruitment and management, may not improbably result in a graver situation. The saving grace is not to be found either in Indianzation as such or in Europeanization as such or any other type or variety of racialization such as Mysoreanization, but if I may venture to say so, in direct University management of medical education which will guarantee a specialist and stable staff with every incentive to keep up their studies and engage in research. And paradoxical as it may sound, some Governments are inclined to adopt University principles without University management. .</p>
		<p>In the United Provinces, Government have handed over their Medical College at Lucknow to the University, one result of which has been the spiriting away of one of the ablest of your medical men, Dr. Acharya, from your midst. Other Governments are organizing in response to the criticism of the General Medical Council bodies of specialists for their Medical Colleges. That is to say, while they will not trust the Universities, they will become Universities themselves: Is this a case of imitation being the sincerest form of flattery or one of stealing their﻿ robes while Universities are still slumbering over their rights?</p>
		<p>Once disentanglement from the Services is decided upon and the organization of a specialist corps adopted in principle, there can be no rational ground for refusing to take the more natural and efficient step of making these colleges integral parts of a teaching University. Let me not be misunderstood. I am deeply grateful to the Services and the organizations that I would like to see supplanted, for the eminent way in which they helped our country in the past and brought her up to a state at which further developments have become inevitable. But gratitude should not be allowed to obstruct duty.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Technological Colleges and the University</strong></p>
		<p>The moral of this is applicable to other technological institutions also. That is why in the Andhra University Act express provision has been made for establishing all the technological institutions to be organized in the future under the direct control and management of the University, of course, with the aid of Government funds.</p>
		<p>If it is wisdom to start all future technical colleges under the immediate auspices of the University, can it be folly to transfer the existing ones to the self-same management? One can't follow easily the logic of this hesitation or rather unwillingness. Apparently Universities can be trusted to do the following: to formulate syllabuses; to inspect and ascertain if the teaching is up to standard;﻿ to hold examinations and to grant degrees. But Universities may not be trusted to appoint the proper teachers and manage institutions; I mean Universities in India, for Universities abroad are of course absolutely trustworthy. If direct University management is held to be less efficient, then would it not be beter for the departments to award their own diplomas instead of making it incumbent on their students to seek effete University degrees?</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>The Essence of a University</strong></p>
		<p>Desirable as all these reforms are and necessary, the essence of University remains to-day what it has always been, namely, a corporation of teachers and taught, a spiritual and cultural entity pursuing knowledge for its own sake, extending the boundaries of Science and Art and functioning as one of the source-powers for increasing humanity's hold on the good, the true and the beautiful. It is this creative spirit that distinguishes a University from the merely distributive function of High Schools. Where that creative spirit is lacking, where it is not conserved and promoted by proper organization and the necessary institutions and facilities inspired by teachers of genius, there we can have nothing more than a Continuation High School.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee</strong></p>
		<p>No one can deal with this, the very soul of University organization, without invoking to his aid the spirit of﻿ Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, the pioneer genius who introduced genuine University education in India. Until he established his Post-Graduate College under direct University management, there were in the true sense of the term neither Universities nor Colleges. Our Universities were mere examining and affiliating Boards; our colleges glorified High Schools.</p>
		<p>Young men fresh from Oxford and Cambridge selected on the lax and false test of their college record were started off as Professors, put in charge of responsible University work, were provided with careers for life and then by sheer force of sumptuous seniority exalted to the headship of departments. No wonder that, as Dr. C.V. Raman has remarked, in most of our Universities, Honours and Post-Graduate courses proved a failure. Even the syllabuses and curricula were not up to date. In many cases they did not represent to any extent growth from within the University but were mechanical importations from the curricula of Western Universities, scissors and paste work! Universities that introduced the distinction between the Pass and Honours Courses were hardly able to maintain that distinction in actual work. Occasionally they tried to enliven the spirit of local teaching by getting a foreign Professor touring in India to deliver a few lectures. If a candidate submitted a thesis for the Doctorate Degree, it had to be exported for adjudication to foreign lands. Even some of our teaching Universities have not come up to standard in their staffing arrangements. They are trying the speculative expedient of sending out brilliant graduates-gold medalists I suppose, though some one or other is bound to get a gold medal every year to England, and this educational pilgrimage for a foreign degree suffices to make them Professors for the rest of their lives, Such is the system of outdoor relief of our pauperism in organization that many of our Universities are not only content to live on but flaunt before an ironical world as symptoms of the high efficiency from which they are suffering. Until the patriotic genius of Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee struck the note, the elementary idea of introducing in our Universities conditions of life and work and staffing, which are the routine of the organization of successful Western Universities, did not suggest itself to the rulers in India, though Gokhale as a member of the Royal Commission on the Public Services had with his usual power of constructive criticism hinted at the rightful measures. Sir Ashutosh had to found his limited but genuine University, so famous to-day all the world over as the Post-Graduate College in Calcutta, on the slender basis of private benefactions though Governmental moneys were never lacking for uneconomical diversions and projects. The old Calcutta University could not be transformed into a real University. Ashutosh's college had, therefore, to be made a Post-Graduate institution, something super-imposed on the University and not so much as the University itself.</p>
		<p>Sir Ashutosh's example has not been without a following. Lucknow and Allahabad have reconstituted themselves as Universities true to type. The Andhra Desa is in the throes of a similar labour, but the agony has been too prolonged.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Principles of Staffing</strong></p>
		<p>If Colleges are regarded as Continuation High Schools, in which what is aimed at is detailed lecturing, the pumping of copious information, digested into notes, into the minds of students, preparing them for examinations, mass production of graduates qualifying for nothing more inspiring than clerical jobs, the Professors too would be recruited on the same principle as High School teachers. They would be chosen merely on their college record and appointed for life. They would be given graded appointments on the assumption that the older they grew the more efficient they became, and there would be talk of graduates of ten years standing and twenty years standing, though very often it is a case more of stooping than of standing, as though intellects mature by sheer process of time, like wine in wood.</p>
		<p>It was with a view to prevent the miscarriage of the objectives of University education that the following recommendations which have served as the basis of the staffing scheme now adopted, were made by the Andhra University Committee so early as 1921:</p>
		<p>"The University should be manned by Professors of high standing who would be able to stimulate the﻿ character and intellects of the students and inspire them to enquiry, research and propaganda."</p>
		<p>"In the Honours and Post-Graduate courses students should be more guided than taught and they should be made, as far as possible, to discover knowledge for themselves rather than have it crammed into them by notes and text-books."</p>
		<p>"It is desirable that Professors should be appointed for a period of ten years but subject to eligibility for reelection. But if the limitation of the term to such a period cannot secure the proper type of Professors,<em> it would be better to make the conditions of service more attractive as by higher salaries, etc., than to abrogate the principle of limited tenure."</em></p>
		<p>"Where specialists have to be employed, the best men should be secured irrespective of nationality, though other things being about equal, preference should be given to Indians, and in the case of such specialists the University should pay whatever sum is necessary to get their services."</p>
		<p>The actual scheme adopted in principle by the Andhra academic authorities is as follows:</p>
		<p>(1) University appointments should not be made on the basis of the college record of the applicants but on the basis of their original work and research.</p>
		<p>(2) Nor should they be on life tenure but on a limited tenure of five to seven years according to the nature of the subject, but with eligibility for reappointment. (This was one of Gokhale's main points.)</p>
		<p>This means, of course, that only specialists should be appointed, the educational consequence of which is that the courses should become more diversified and greater choice given to students to specialize. Optional courses should be enormously increased, the result being small classes, less lecturing, the students being left to work for themselves under general guidance, 'mental and moral development of the students to a greater extent than is possible under the system of detailed lecturing and mass production of graduates, and hopeful preparation for genuine intellectual life.</p>
		<p>(3) As at Lucknow, the Syndicate may, for special reasons, appoint a Professor on special terms.</p>
		<p>There will be no Assistant Professors and the word Assistant connoting some kind of personal subordination to a superior has been abolished from the Andhra classification. Professors, Readers, etc., will have their own spheres of work, arranged by the Faculties and all will have enough leisure to pursue their researches and satisfy their moral craving for name and fame. Even though there may be differences in material conditions, there ought not to be any in the fellowship that should prevail. The ViceChancellor himself should function as a brotherly elder without assumption of superior authority or superior wisdom. Nothing is so destructive of the integrity of University life as the mandarinism of mediocrities, breeding jealousies, producing an atmosphere of self-centred calculations, and breaking up comradeship. With a genuine﻿ University staff, segregated from the Civil List and intent on high-souled pursuits, this will not happen, but a fraternal spirit will prevail.</p>
		<p>In Western Universities, Professors not uncommonly lecture sometimes only one hour a week but never more than three to four hours a week and they lecture on the subjects of their own research and not necessarily on examination topics. These latter are attended to by the Lecturers and Readers but even they are not so heavily worked as High School teachers, because, since all are appointed on account of their original work, they must be given time and scope for carrying on their researches as otherwise it would result in a criminal waste of talent. There should be far less lecturing in our colleges and great many more lecturers to do that less lecturing!</p>
		<p>The way to Lecturerships, Readerships and Professorships must be prepared by a large scheme of Fellowships. The most brilliant men, men with clear promise of originality, should be made Fellows on an adequate allowance, say Rs. 150 a month, the allowance adopted in the Andhra University, so that they may be saved from the worry of creature necessities. The Fellowships should be tenable for a period of, say, three years and such of the Fellows as fulfil expectations should be drafted on to the teaching posts.</p>
		<p>In the recruitment of the staff, merit should be the only consideration. Students should not be defrauded of their right to receive the best and most inspiring training under the plea of localism or communalism. A University organization of this type would obviate the evil of what Sir P. C. Ray has called mass production of graduates and consequent unemployment of the educated. Once High School methods are discontinued at the college stage, students incapable of working according to University standards will drop out. Employment of specialists, diversified courses, increased options, smaller classes, selfhelp and self-reliance on the part of students, the joy of research work, the disinterested pursuit of knowledge, and daily contact with noble souls-all these go together, and they will help to obviate both mass production of graduates and sterile, insignificant careers. It is miseducation, not over-education, that has been the bane of the country.</p>
		<p>I think the ideal University will in its form and constitution be as democratic and autonomous as the Andhra University and in the field of substantial work covered, an amalgam of the Calcutta Post-Graduate College and the Lucknow and Mysore Universities. Has not Sir Ashutosh's College been a glorious success? Are not the Palit, Ghosh, Hardinge, King George V and other Professorships a world-asset to-day, and if the Calcutta College could succeed in producing such an amazing amount of research in every branch of learning, why should any one doubt the success of an institution of the kind imagined here it may be a dream to-day but I trust it will be a reality soon-thus organized and having a wider range of activities?﻿</p>
		<p>Even a crore of rupees is not the limit of useful expenditure on a University. Our governments are not spending on their Universities a tenth of what they shouldnot even Mysore.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Lord Goschen on the Ideal <br />of the Andhra University</strong></p>
		<p>His Excellency the Chancellor of the Andhra University in laying down his policy thus expressed himself in his inspiring address to the last Andhra Convocation, an address which has been hailed as the Magna Carta of the University:</p>
		<p>"The ideal that we have set before us is the development, not of a University in the sense of a brick and mortar structure, but a University community- a large and mutually stimulating and inspiring community of Professors with an assured standing for creative output, and Researchers and Scholars. It is only by evolving such a community that we should be contributing our solution or rather the academic factor in the solution of the problem of building up a healthy, strong, well-balanced judgement ' and character in the youth of our country."</p>
		<p>Ah, if only institutional reality could soon be given to these noble aspirations.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Character and College</strong></p>
		<p>If the youth of our country are lacking in judgement, will and character, it is to some extent because of the﻿ defective nature of the education they receive at the University. We prolong their boyhood from High School to College and then we wonder that they don't grow up into manhood but remain boys with all the attractions and weaknesses of boyhood. At one moment they would be going about as though they were possessed of all knowledge and could bring about the instantaneous salvation of India if only their way was not barred by their elders, whose wisdom and experience they treat as naught. To such I can only repeat the scornful admonition of the old moralist, who was 'apparently thinking of graduates in their academic caps, "Remember thou art a chicken just hatched with the shell still on they head." Anon these same graduates at the first icy touch of life's sharp realities will be seen going about or rather drifting about with helpless look and hopeless outlook beseeching people to advise them as to what they should do. They know how to prepare themselves for examinations having ended, they do not know what to do with themselves. If there were examinations and parental financial assistance till they reached 55 years of age, when they could retire on a pension, that would be near to their notion of an earthly paradise. If the intellectual and social discipline- I hope they have had both-connoted by a four-years University career has not helped them to find their bearings in life, has not given them judgement, taste and will sufficient to enable them to determine their careers, no Convocation Address could avail to save such ineffectual craft from foundering miserably. This is one reason why I have avoided the tone of moral exhortation customary on these occasions. I am tired of the annual letting off of idealistic fire-works in the Convocation sky and sentimental adoration of the departed glories of Nalanda, Takshashila and Amaravati. The Hindu mind revels in myth-craft; and once you are departed, you can safely reckon on becoming a glory! It is the duty of those that are not amply confident of building a big future to reverse their attention and create a glorious past; and this duty we have always fulfilled to our entire and exclusive satisfaction.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Our True Task</strong></p> 
		<p>The true task before us is to bring these ideals down to earth and give them body, shape and functioning power in organization, institution and administration. True, their working can never be automatic- either fool-proof or knave-proof-and, must depend on character and personality. However much we may give institutional regulation to our moral aspirations, there is always an elusive soul beyond the reach of analytical grasp and administrative envisagement which can be felt only by intuition; a mystic surd, racial and individual, which cannot be resolved into rational factors but which is the source of all power and vital virtue, the grace and salvation of life. Where that soul is lacking, institutions like bodies will decay. The recent history of India shows that the soul of our people is not dead but alive and capable of expressing itself in spite of the debris and disabilities heaped upon it by ages of disastrous history. Whoever would﻿ have thought that Sir Ashutosh's College entirely staffed by Indians would in a decade produce such an astonishing amount of original work, astonishing alike in volume and quality and prove an acquisition to world-culture? "United like word and meaning," like beautiful word and soulful meaning, that pregnant phrase of Kalidas aptly describes the happy conjunction needed for realizing the fulness of life. The power of thought is there in our countrymen; the soul, imperishable, sublime; only the instrumentality of institutions is lacking. It is for the rulers and leaders of India not to be content with sentimentalizing over ideals and providing merely verbal incentives to lofty conduct but to bestir themselves with vigorous and honest purpose to the task of establishing the requisite secular conditions and organizations. Then would our spiritual revival be assured and abundant.</p>
		<p>Mr. Vice-Chancellor, let me conclude by conveying to you and the Mysore University the greetings of the Andhra University and wishing the graduates assembled here useful and happy careers,﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Convocation<br />of the University of Mysore, on the 24th August 1929, by Sir C.V. Raman,<br />Kt., M.A., D.Sc. (Hons.), F.R.S.</h1>
		<p>Mr. VICE-CHANCELLOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>I felt highly honoured by the invitation to address this Convocation, and did not hesitate to accept it, even though, coming at a time just prior to my departure for Europe on scientific deputation, it has involved a certain dislocation of my work. For many years, I have felt a keen interest in the fortunes of Mysore, and of late my visits to the State have been so frequent that I might almost claim to be acquiring a domicile in His Highness' territory. The fact that Mysore has in the past offered scope for the activities of such distinguished administrators as Sir K. Seshadri or Sir M. Visvesvaraya, and claimed the allegiance even temporarily of a Brajendra Nath Seal or a Radhakrishnan is in itself sufficient to invest the State with a certain halo of glory. There is much in Mysore to arrest the attention of every educated Indian. The great works of public utility at Sivasamudram and Krishnarajasagara, and the industrial activities of the State at Bangalore and Bhadravati, would alone have been sufficient to set Mysore on a pedestal, to be viewed with respectful admiration by other parts of India. The fame of Mysore﻿ has been spread far and wide by these and other evidences of the wisdom and enterprise on the part of her ruler and of those who have helped in her administration. As a man of science, my whole-hearted admiration goes out to that act of far-sighted policy which led to the establishment at Bangalore of the Indian Institute of Science. The full fruits of that act may yet some day be reaped in a harvest of fame and wealth for the Mysore State, nay, for all India. For several years, the affairs of the Institute have claimed my personal attention, and it has been my constant endeavour to try and hasten the advent of that glorious day.</p>
		<p>At no time in the history of India, so far as I am aware, did the cultural contacts of the different parts of our great country altogether cease. Developments in any part of India have had, and will continue to have, repercussions in every other part of the country. For this reason, if for no other, the progress of Mysore will be watched with the keenest interest in other parts of India. If Mysore advances, it will rejoice the heart of every Indian. If she lags behind, the rest of India will also suffer. No one doubts to-day that Mysore has a special and distinctive contribution of her own to make to our national culture.</p>
		<p>As one instance of the way in which different parts of India can benefit by an exchange of ideas, I can mention the activities of the Indian Science Congress. I have even to-day the most vivid recollection of my first visit to Bangalore﻿ in 1917. Many pictures stand out in my memory, of those few days of hectic activity. The unaffected, though impressive, kindness with which the delegates to the Congress were received by His Highness in the grounds of the Palace amidst the sweet strain of Indian music, the first impressions of Bangalore with its notable public buildings and a general aspect to strikingly individualistic, the odoriferous activities of the sandalwood oil factory, the great campus of the Indian Institute of Science which for the time being became an arena for a boomerang display by a former DirectorGeneral of Observatories, these and other vignettes remain firmly impressed in my memory. Remarkably enough, however, what interested me most in that visit to Bangalore was a little tube of glass six inches long and half an inch broad which I saw used in a demonstration at one of our meetings. That little tube of glass filled with the glowing vapour of mercury and emitting a dazzling white light came to me as a revelation. It opened my eyes to the immense power of the mercury arc as a tool of scientific research. You have all read in the "Arabian Nights" the story of how Alladin discovered, by accident, the secret of the wonderful lamp that was later to bring him wealth and fame. Alladin rubbed the lamp, and out came a mighty spirit ready to do his bidding. It is no exaggeration to say that the quartz mercury arc is the veritable Alladin's lamp of modern physics. Under the touch of the electric current springs from it a mighty spirit, travelling with the velocity of light, capable of performing the most wonderful tasks, a spirit capable of making itself as small as a hundred millionth part of an inch, nay, of entering within the atom or the molecule itself and of exploring its internal structure. It was no accidental coincidence that eleven years later, it was the same mercury arc lamp which served me to discover the new radiation effect which you may have heard of, and it was equally no accident that within a few days of the discovery, I chose a group of scientific men gathered at the same Central College at Bangalore as the audience before whom to place the first scientific account of the discovery.</p>
		<p>There is no sphere of human activity which tends to draw peoples of divers lands and cultures together and create bonds of sympathy and friendly understanding so much as the pursuit of knowledge. Knowledge is universal by its very nature. A fact of nature newly discovered is a discovery whose significance or utility cannot be altered by the colour of the discoverer's skin or his nationality. Hence, recognition of such discovery is usually spontaneous. A striking example of this is furnished by the fact that the bitter feelings existing between England and Germany during the war did not prevent Englishmen of science giving the fullest and promptest recognition to the work of Einstein. The speedy reconciliation of England and Germany that has followed after the war is, I believe, due not a little to the cultural and intellectual domination which Germany continues to exercise over the whole world and which remains unaffected by her defeat on the field of battle.﻿</p>
		<p>Intellectual activity of the highest type such as every University should strive to develop is. a force of incalculable power and importance for the national welfare. Apart from the direct results of such activity in promoting agricultural, industrial or commercial progress, its indirect results are even more important. Intellectual stagnation is equivalent to national decay and death. Intellectual activity, on the other hand, leads to a quickening of the national life in all its aspects. To a normal human being in full possession of his faculties, the ideal of healthful happiness is not a life of slothful inactivity or placid contemplation, but one of varied activity, both physical and mental, interspersed by the minimum periods of rest which Nature demands for recuperation. Either physical or mental activity by itself is incomplete and insufficient for the maintenance of human efficiency at its highest level. The mainsprings of intellectual activity in every country are education and the spirit of inquiry, and its quality varies with the standard set by the thinkers and educators of the nation. Thus, in the last analysis, it is the leadership offered by the Universities that determines the level of intellectual activity in the country and therefore also the national efficiency.</p>
		<p>In thus drawing attention to the relationship between national welfare and the work done in the Universities, I would wish to emphasise the danger of allowing such work to degenerate into a deadly routine of formal teaching and formal examination. The tendency of all formal schemes of education is to regard the human mind as a kind of﻿ soft metal to be squeezed into shape by intense pressure into the hard steel moulds of syllabuses and examinations. This kind of mechanization of education is, I believe, most deadly in its effects, and is responsible for not a little of the intellectual sterility of the finished products of our Universities. The essence of education is the development of individuality and personality, and it is easily possible to carry the idea of formal training and intellectual discipline to the point of extinguishing such individual development. I would say that the good is often the enemy of the best. Formal training should make way in favour of individual freedom of study and work wherever and whenever the latter promises the best results. It is here that the discernments and sympathy of the teacher are most needed.</p>
		<p>The ideal of University work is the provision of opportunities for special abilities, of teacher as well as of students, to express themselves. How this is to be done without dislocating the general activities of the University is, I consider, one of the most important problems in University administration, and its successful solution requires the most careful and sympathetic consideration. It is my conviction that, at the present time, Indian Universities generally pay less attention to the development of special activities and abilities and more to purely routine activities than should really be the case. In a general way, of course, the differentiation between pass and honours courses recognizes the importance of giving special opportunities for special ability. But this, in my view, is not enough. There should be greater freedom for the expression of individual ability, and more time and opportunities for research work, for teacher and student alike, in those cases where evidence of ability to profit by such opportunities is forthcoming.</p>
		<p>During the last few years, there has been a growing recognition that India is not a negligible factor in the advance of human knowledge. I will go further and say that the world outside has begun to learn that the Indian intellect can occasionally march abreast, or perhaps even lead, in the onward march of scientific progress. This is certainly a position in advance of that freely expressed ten years ago that the Indian mind was by nature sterile, and is, in my opinion, largely the result of the work of the younger generation of scientific workers in India during the last ten years. But the position reached is, in my opinion, still quite unsatisfactory. A great many new Universities have sprung up all over the country and in many of them Indians are holding appointments with some opportunities for original work. Some of them are, no doubt, showing praiseworthy activity. But taken altogether, I think, not enough is being done. The reason for this is a matter which I would recommend to the University administrative bodies all over India carefully to investigate and set right without delay. In some cases, it may be lack of opportunities for research, by reason of excessive insistence on routine teaching; in others it may be lack of research equipment. I hardly think the lack of competent students or helpers can be the cause. If there is any point on which I feel a confidence derived from experience, it is that there is abudance of talent in the younger generation awaiting the right kind of leadership.</p>
		<p>The field of human knowledge at the present time is in an extremely interesting state. The principal feature of the activity of the nineteenth century may be described as the fragmentation of knowledge into a large number of small holdings with uncultivated boundaries between them- mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, geology, botany, zoology, sociology, economics, politics, psychology, philosophy and so forth. During the last twenty years, however, a strong movement has set in towards a new synthesis of knowledge. A change has occurred in our philosophic outlook which is tantamount to a recognition that, in spite of her immense diversity, Nature is still one and indivisible. The barriers artificially set up by the nineteenth century between the different branches of knowledge are fast crumbling to pieces and in many cases, for instance as between physics and chemistry, have completely disappeared at the present time. The current of present-day progress thus gives a new strength to the University idea which recognizes the essential impartibility of that great estate which we call human knowledge. Not only so, but this also gives us fresh reason for hoping that India with her well-known power of synthetic and philosophic thought may yet, if she exerts herself, rise once again to a position in which she can lead the world﻿ in intellectual advance. But this is a mere possibility and to convert it into an actuality requires strenuous effort, and calls for a revival of our ancient love of learning compared with which the Renaissance of Europe in the Middle Ages would sink into insignificance.</p>
		<p>The spirit of modern knowledge is repugnant to vague and unsupported speculations. An unhesitating rejection awaits generalizations, however attractive, based on mere sentiment or belief, or on an incomplete analysis of experience or experiment. Rigour, logic, precision, attention to detail, a disinclination to gloss over essential differences, and the most rigid power of self-criticism, -these are what modern science demands. These habits of mind are hardly developed by the mere passive absorption of knowledge in the lecture room or library. Indeed, knowledge as embodied in a formal treastise or lecture is apt to convey an impression of static perfection which is deceptive and induces the mind to adopt an attitude of uncritical acceptance. The highest qualities of mind are evoked by knowledge which presents itself in a dynamic but imperfect form, calling for criticism and personal investigation for its adequate appraisal. This is the real value of research as an instrument of education in itself. The attitude of mind habitually adopted by the investigator is the one that not only leads to the advances of knowledge, but also develops his own inherent intellectual powers and enables him to apply his store of knowledge with success to new or old problems that press for solution. The promotion of such an attitude of mind in the intellectual products﻿ of the University is a matter of the greatest importance for the welfare of the State.</p>
		<p>Real culture includes within itself an appreciation not only of intellectual values but also of social virtues. A truly cultured man has no use for dogmatisms, fanaticisms or unreasoning beliefs or prejudices of any kind. A University ceases to be a temple of learning and becomes a breeding place for the microbes of ignorance if it lends itself to the propagation of the religious antagonisms and of the communal jealousies that disfigure the public life of our country at the present time. A University should, above all things, be a place where personal ability and personal character are alone the passports to success, and a broad tolerance enables men of divergent views to work together for a common cause. If our Universities are animated by such ideals, they will prove a much more potent power for the building up of a great nation than Congresses and Councils, and solve the problem of the future of our country more effectively than Leagues and Legislatures. It is my earnest hope that the younger generation of University-trained men will in this matter have a saner outllok than our self-constituted political leaders. It is to you that I look to see the country set on the high road which leads to national honour and regeneration, and not on the wrong turning which can only lead to national humiliation and decay.</p>
		<p>No convocation address can be complete which altogether avoids the political issue. There is no denying﻿ the existence to-day, both in British India and in Indian India, of political unrest. There is, however, no better tribute to the wisdom of the administration of His Highness the Maharaja than the fact that this problem is much less acute in Mysore than elsewhere in India. It is often suggested that unrest is due to education and will disappear with a restriction of educational facilities. I entirely disagree with this view, and believe that the real cure for unrest is an extension of education and the provision of special opportunities for those qualified by special energy, intelligence and ability to advance knowledge, to promote its useful applications and thus add to the national efficiency and wealth. On the broader issue of national self-determination, I will suggest to the young graduates of this University, and to others in a similar position elsewhere, that if we wish men of other nations to respect us and yield to our wishes, we must learn to respect ourselves and make ourselves worthy of respect from others. We must abolish slothfulness and self-indulgence, and substitute in their place a mentality that recognizes the highest form of human happiness to be that which is reached by labour · and self-restraint. We must put aside a spirit of defeatism and put in its place a spirit that glories in the overcoming of obstacles. We must learn to appreciate and use the products of Indian labour however imperfect they may be. We must acquire by labour and thought the secret of craftsmanship which lies in meticulous attention to detail and the continual striving after perfection. We must refrain﻿ from copying the vices and expensive habits of other countries and never forget that alcohol and nicotine are the deadliest of poisons known to humanity. Finally, we must never forget that the strength of our people depends quite as much on our women as on our men. The richest rewards are the fruit of labour, study and thought. Self-determination will come, but we must prepare ourselves for it. It is no use asking for freedom if we are not prepared to pay the price for it.</p>
		<p>Graduates of the Mysore University, it has been my privilege during the past few years to come into intimate contact with several members of your University, both teachers and students, and to learn to appreciate their zeal and enthusiasm, and the valuable contribution that the Mysore University is making towards the promotion of sound learning in Southern India. I have been very fortunate during the past few years to have been able to welcome a number of students from Mysore to my laboratory at Calcutta and the ability and industry they displayed was a credit not only to themselves, but also to their teachers and the training they received in your University. Some of them even displayed striking originality and capacity for research, and it is a matter of great regret to me that lack of financial resources prevented me from inducing them to continue their researches at Calcutta beyond the stage of the Master's Degree in Science. I have, however, endeavoured to be of service to such men in procuring for them a suitable career in life. I know also that students﻿ from Mysore who have come to Calcutta to study other branches of science besides physics have won the admiration of my colleagues in the University by their capacity and zeal. All this reflects the highest credit on your Alma Mater, and it is my earnest hope that you will resolve in your future career to serve her interests as best as you can. I join with your teachers in wishing for you a prosperous and successful career in life according to your respective abilities. Farewell.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS<br />By Dr. E. P. METCALFE, D.Sc., F. Inst. P., Vice-Chancellor,<br/>University of Mysore, at the Convocation of the<br/>University of Mysore, on the 29th October 1986.</h1>
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESS, GRADUATES OF THE UNIVERSITY,<br />LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p>We are just now entering the second century of English education in India. Almost exactly a hundred years ago was sown the seed which has yielded the university systems of today. So accustomed have we become to the shapes taken by our Universities, which in fundamentals are similar to those of representative Universities in other parts of the world, that we may be forgiven for losing sight of the very real controversy that took place so long ago on the question of the type of higher education best suited to the genius and the needs of the country. The issue was ultimately decided on a variety of considerations, at least one of them being frankly utilitarian, namely, the need for, suitably cultured people to work an administration which was to be carried on, in its higher stages, in English.</p>
		<p>It was then, as it has always been since, a cardinal principle of the theory of British Government in India that the people should be prepared to accept in increasing measure the burden of the administration, such preparation involving among other things the cultivation of a feeling of unity and﻿ a spirit of self-reliance. The extent and speediness of the emergence of such qualities would naturally depend very largely on the proper choice of an educational system.</p>
		<p>I think that retrospect compels the acceptance of the conclusion that the policy adopted in principle a century ago has been justified. Said Macaulay of the people of India, "Having become instructed in European knowledge they may in some future age demand European institutions. . . . . . . When such a day comes, it will be the proudest in English history.” Such a day has now very obviously arrived--almost, according to the views of some, to the point of embarrassment. It is of interest to reflect on the extent to which the form of higher education chosen has helped and hastened its arrival, and to try to imagine the position of India today had Persian been continued as the language of office and become the common language of higher culture in consequence.</p>
		<p>There can be no doubt that in the social and political reconstruction of an Indian nation from ethnological material of wide diversity of culture, incompatibility of interests, mutual unintelligibility in language and many other centrifugal characteristics, the imposition of a common language of culture, though foreign equally to all (and perhaps for that very reason) and of a novel type of culture, has provided a powerful medium of union.</p>
		<p>In a hundred years English education has permeated the whole of this vast territory, providing the people with the gift of expression in a universal world language, bringing with it the power of participation in the most modern of world movements and﻿ facilitating the fresh contribution of India to human progress, and ultimately evolving a national consciousness. One sees the guiding hand of Providence in the decision taken in 1837 to educate India in the English language.</p>
		<p>It was the clear intention of the fathers of English education in India to place the people in possession of the fundamentals of modern science. The first indent "for what was then called “philosophical apparatus " had already been sent to England from Calcutta; and the appointment of a professor of experimental science had at least been contemplated. I quote from Mayhew's <em>Education of India:</em> “As though to mark India's departure on the westward road, a Brahmin demonstrator before a hushed and breathless class.... had dissected a huinan body!”</p>
		<p>In spite of such efforts, modern science does not seem to have made much appeal to the India of those days. Even in 1857, the foundation year of the mother Universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, pure science subjects did not find a place in the first curricula of studies. It was not long before they were introduced and it may be supposed that the methods of teaching them were not dissimilar from those practised at the time in England. Towards the end of the nineteenth century the teaching of science was improved in England by the introduction of practical laboratory courses for students. India was unfortunately slow to follow this lead. I feel certain that the prolonged adherence to the lecturecum-text-book system of study in science was mainly, if not entirely, responsible for the very wrong and harmful attitude towards such studies and indeed towards study in general) which was prevalent in﻿ India thirty years ago. A sense of unreality was generated in relation to scientific theory and experimental fact--a feeling that these things were said to be so by certain vague persons a very long way off, that it was desirable to know what those individuals said and thought about these things, because such information, if ready for production at the time of a competitive or other examination, won credit in the form of marks. But the possibility that the new knowledge which was being so rapidly gathered and coordinated abroad might be a vital matter with immediate practical applications, both personal and social, could hardly be grasped by a student sitting still while his teacher manipulated symbols and diagrams on a blackboard and occasionally performed mysterious and only half-seen operations on the lecture bench, with a piece of imported apparatus. As for any aspiration on the part of the pupil himself to add to that kind of knowledge, such an idea must have been beyond his wildest imagining. A scientific instrument was to be handled in a reverent, almost sacerdotal, spirit by the teacher only. Should it become damaged or out of adjustment, either a new one must be substituted or the defective one sent on a journey of thousands of miles for repair at the hands of the magician who made it. Such a system could not fail to perpetuate a deep sense of inferiority in respect of new knowledge.</p>
		<p>About twenty-five years ago a change came over the spirit of university education in India, the first expression of which, in our region, was the institution of new intermediate courses by the University of Madrás. That reform marked a turning point in the cultural history of India of real significance. From﻿ it-and, I verily believe, very largely because of it, -dates the period of the recent intellectual unfolding in India, a phenomenon produced, no doubt, by a combination of causes and circumstances; but of these, I am sure that one of the most potent was the change of educational inethod, particularly in Science, in the Universities. It may seem but a small thing at a first glance, this introduction of three hours of practical laboratory training in the week's work of an elementary student. It represented, however, a complete alteration of the student's approach to the subject of study; it provided an object lesson in his own potentialities as an experimenter and observer, a suggestion, that he too might become in due time a wrester of Nature's secrets. In fact, it substituted for the idea of an educational process of passive reception that of active pursuit by the student, accompanied, aided and abetted by his teacher. An attitude of mind is apt to be contagious; enthusiasms have a way of spreading. In whatever manner it may have operated, that reform has had a remarkably stimulating effect in developing intellectual initiative not only among students of Science but ainong our cultured classes generally. If we require a monument, we have but to look round on the achievements of Indians in almost every cultural field during this last quarter-century.</p>
		<p>The idea of making his own contribution to new knowledge is no longer foreign to the serious student in India. The habit of pursuing some line of original investigation has become fairly common, especially among university teachers, and is encouraged by all wise university administrations. We occasionally hear critical remarks passed by members of the public﻿ on our efforts to foster the spirit of research within the University, on the ground mainly that such time and money as we can manage to find for research work would be better spent on more teaching for more students and that the intrinsic value of the “discoveries "made is not commensurate with the expenditure, even on our modest scale. It must be made clear that we do not expect an output of important discovery, though we occasionally get it. What we want is that every teacher should continue to be a sincere student; and devotion to a line of original investigation is the best evidence that a teacher is keeping himself abreast of progress in some region of his subject. Moreover, a man who is himself an investigator is likely to prove a much more efficient teacher, able to use his imagination and to draw on his own experience and to induce in his pupils a critical and independent attitude of mind, which relegates the text-book to its proper position as a guide rather than an ultimate authority. If for no other reason, since one of the chief objects of education is to strengthen character, the encouragement of the research spirit in every teaching department of a university is not merely legitimate, but a positive duty.</p>
		<p>In this respect I feel that we are moving on right lines and that we have already developed a satisfactory atmosphere in our various departments in respect of our standards and of our attitude towards study. We have, among our teaching staff, a good proportion of keen workers in original research, who act as conductors of the stream of recent discovery through their respective departments of knowledge to which, moreover, they themselves are making their own﻿ contributions. We have been able, in the course of years, to accumulate literature and appliances, so that we liave for some time been in a position to afford facilities for advanced workers in nearly all our departments, and this equipment is being continually added to and kept up to date.</p>
		<p>Such measure of success as we have achieved in these directions would not have been possible without adequate support. A tribute is due here to the liberality of view which has distinguished the policy of the Government of Mysore in respect of our university institutions and later, after its foundation, of our University as a whole. It is always in fashion to criticize Government-it is perhaps one of the chief functions of a government to sustain criticism. Comment has not infrequently been made on the failure of the administration to furnish what may have been considered to be necessary finance for the expansion of the activities of the University-in fact, I may have been guilty of such coinments myself, on occasion. But Governments have, unfortunately, to find money for other things besides Universities. If we compare the average expenditure on University education since abont 1910 with what it was during the twenty-five years preceding that date, we cannot fail to be struck by the very real effort which has been made to enable our university education to reach the international standard. We, members of the University, may regard this effort as a practical expression on the part of the State of confidence in ourselves; and we must see to it that we continue to merit this confidence.</p>
		<p>In common with our sister Universities we have helped to build up the university system of India﻿ from sinall beginnings. This edifice has been constructed, all of it within eighty years; and most of it within the last twenty-five. We have come into line with other countries in respect of methods of study and standards of courses. By encouraging research We ali stimulating interest in acquiring and eren adding to new knowledge.</p>
		<p>We may now inquire in what manner and to what extent our achieveinent is conferring benefit on the country as a whole. Speaking of this University and of our country of Mysore, I suppose we may fairly claim to have produced a cultured upper class which otherwise would not have existed, or not in its present form. Within this cultured class we have trained bands of technicians--teachers, physicians and surgeons, engineers, administrators. Of the work of our technicians we may be justly proud. The Mysore State has gained an enviable reputation in the fields of administration, education, engineering and medicine--a reputation which has been earned very largely by the efforts of alumni of our own University Institutions. The University, though yet young, stands well in the estimation of the intellectual world of India. It has taken a sufficiently prominent and representative part in many activities of an all-India range. In all these respects it may be considered to be fulfilling its <em>dharma.</em> But is this to be regarded as the whole <em>dharma</em> of an Indian University ?</p>
		<p>This is a large question, so large that it cannot even begin to be considered in the course of a short address. I may, however, be permitted to suggest one or two lines along which thought may be directed.﻿</p>
		<p>First of all, are we adequately supplying a need ? In spite of the frequent complaints levelled against our universities that our methods are wasteful, our policies ill-directed, our products largely unemployable, the fact remains that, judging from the demand for admission, university education is becoming more and more appreciated among certain sections of the population. This popularity may be due to a desire, for its own sake, for the type of cultural training we purvey; or it may be for the practical amenities that that culture is expected to secure. Many people will, I am afraid, hold with the latter explanation which is supported by the feeling that we are turning out too many graduates in relation to the fields of employment that lie open to them; and the cry is raised that university policy should be directed to the invasion of fresh fields. To the question of where those fresh fields lie, no very convincing reply seems to be forthcoming, either from our critics or from any one else.</p>
		<p>A second question concerns the relations of the Universities to the general population. Have the Universities any duties to the common or uneducated people? If so, what; and to what extent are these duties being discharged ?</p>
		<p>According to an ancient proverb, the musician is expected to adapt his melody to the requirements of those who provide his remuneration. Most of our Indian Universities are financed largely from public funds. In the case of this University, by far the greater part of the whole cost of maintenance is borne by the tax-payers, the bulk of whom are in humble circumstances. Are these people deriving all possible advantage from their University ? That they do derive a very considerable advantage, though perhaps in a rather indirect manner, cannot be denied. The ministrations of the professional classes, to which I have alluded, constitute a great public benefit. But it is not inconceivable that we might be of still more, and more direct, service to our paymasters.</p>
		<p>The demand for and supply of university education has, during the last twenty or thirty years, increased in a phenomenal manner. In 1910 the number of Intermediate students in the university institutions in this State was about 300. Today the corresponding number is over five times as large. At first sight this might appear to be a matter for pure "congratulation-the demand for culture having grown more than five hundred per cent in twenty-five years. But what, I would ask, of the corresponding illiteracy statistics for the State as a whole ?</p>
		<p>It was one of the intentions of the founders of "English education" in India that it should exert a reflex action on the intellectual condition of the masses by a process of cultural percolation downwards. Can the Indian Universities, our own among them, be regarded as fulfilling their dharma in this respect? I propound this, not as a rhetorical question, but as a genuine inquiry, without presuming to furnish or even to suggest an answer.</p>
		<p>As an example of what can be done in the way of direct action, I must refer to a very praiseworthy enterprise undertaken by certain members of our staff under the auspices of a Teachers' Association which they have formed. During the University recesses this Association organizes brief expeditions to selected rural centres. For a week or so at a time the days are filled with lectures and demonstrations intended﻿ for the general public, conducted mainly in Kannada, and dealing with a wide variety of subjects of practical and cultural value. In this the workers are assisted by the local authorities and to a small extent by the University. Their efforts have earned the warm appreciation of the localities which have been served. In this work the University Teachers' Association has given us &#38; practical demonstration of the possibility of direct service to the rural population by the University. I wish we could afford to support this movement much more effectively; but unfortunately the inhibiting effects of the depression period are still with us; and this movement represents but one annong several directions in which our usefulness might, in more propitious eircumstances, have been extended. This is perhaps a not unsuitable occasion for a special appeal to the publicminded citizen with a little money to spare, with the suggestion that a donation towards the expenses of the education weeks of the Teachers' Association is likely to be more fruitful than if devoted to the foundation of more scholarships or prizes, of which, quite frankly, I think the University has already enough.</p>
		<p>It is trite, but fundamentally true and the key fact to the present economic problem in India, that an improvement in the condition of the labouring classes must precede any improvement in that of the rest of the social fabric. Public Enemy No. 1 in India is illiteracy, and must be attacked as such by every resource of men, money and method. It appears to mne that not nearly enough force is being concentrated against this citadel of darkness. Consider these figures: in the twenty years between 1912 and 1932﻿ the percentage of illiterates over five years of age taken over the whole of our population, urban and rural, fell from 93 to 89'4. Contrast this with the expansion in the volume of university education during the same period. If asked to name the most potent single agency of the civilization of this age, one would answer the Printing Press.” The faculty of reading is a sixth sense which civilization has developed in mankind, as important in its way as hearing or seeing. Yet ninety per cent of our population are defective in this sense, suffering from a curable defect which, in my humble opinion, not nearly sufficient effort is being made to cure.</p>
		<p>Judging from results, it would appear that the plan of campaign against illiteracy has failed and that some new form of attack must be devised. If I may venture a suggestion, there is perhaps a lack of suitable inducement to learn to read. Literature of the right kind is neither abundant nor sufficiently accessible. In countries where literacy is general, the habit of reading is catered for by a vast volume of ephemeral literature in the form of cheap newspapers. Some of the most successful daily papers in England lay themselves out to provide special matter for each of various classes of readers. I have a feeling that far more could be done by the cheap or even free distribution of a suitable Kannada Daily Mail or even Daily Mirror than by any of the devices which have been tried. There are already, of course, a number of Kannada papers in circulation, some of them of very considerable merit. But possibly they take themselves a trifle too seriously to offer any strong inducement to the country folk to learn to read for recreation.﻿</p>
		<p>By eradicating illiteracy work will be provided for a litcrary class. The root cause of the unemployment of the educated upper classes lies in the economic inability of the uneducated lower classes to cinploy them. The social and economic salvation of the Kannada . people can only come through the Kannada language <em>in print.</em></p>
		<p>The University is now engaged on a monuinental work in this very field, a work which cannot fail to contribute something to the betterment of the people. I refer to the compilation of an EnglishKannada Dictionary, which will, in an authoritative manner, facilitate translation and will render Kannada capable of conveying ideas on the inost modern techrical topics. The notion of such a work first occurred to a small group of ardent and patriotic Kannada scholars; but it was only under the direct encouragement-I inay say, quite active stimulation--of our Dewan, Sir Mirza Ismail, that it took practical shape. This work will take about seven years to completo and it will be without a parallel in any Dravidian language. It will represent a inost important contritution not only to the practical and cultural advancement of the Kannada people both in and outside this State but also to the study of Dravidian linguistics Incidentally it appears to be the cheapest book, for its size and content, ever sold. I suggest that every patriotic Kannadliga should at once order his copy.</p>
		<p>Within the University too originated the two first Karnataka Sanghas which have done so much for the revival of Kannada literature.</p>
		<p>The University is by no means unmindful of its responsibilities towards the people. But extra-mural work organized on an adequate scalo requires esta﻿blishment and finance. Given these essentials I have no doubt that future administrations in the University will turn their efforts more and more towards extra-mural work, which, I trust, the advent of rather better times will render possible.</p>
		<p>To those graduating today I offer my felicitations. I hope that a life of happiness and service lies before every one of you. These two things are closely related; and the degree of your achievement of them lies almost entirely within yourselves.</p>
		<p>Besides pleasure and privilege, the cultured life brings its special difficulties and problems and duties to be overcome, solved and performed to the best of one's individual ability. The surest shield against a great and important group of humor troubles is a transparent honesty of purpose and of dealing. The cynical statement of the degrees of comparison, getting on, getting honour and getting honest, must be read from right to left to be true.</p>
		<p>Though today you formally cease to be members of the University and your period of pupilage closes, I trust you will continue as students in the true sense for the rest of your lives. If the University has not taught you to teach yourselves you are taking nothing from us of permanent value, I suppose that most thinking people will agree that one of the things we owe to ourselves during the period of our earthly pilgrimage is to develop personality, an entity which is a complex of all our qualities. In some of our qualities, chiefly those of the spirit, we can and should increase up to the last. Among these is the culture which is born of knowledge and experience. I would urge you therefore as a duty to yourselves, never to abandon the habit of study which I trust we have succeeded﻿ in inculcating in you. Be liberal in your views and patient of those of others. Some of you, no doubt, will, in the course of time, assume positions of authority and responsibility. When that time comes you will be well advised to be the most severe critics of your own actions and opinions. Welcome friendly criticism and try not to resent that which may be not friendly. Pay more attention to the arguments of your opponents than to those of your supporters; because the latter echo your own, while the former may exhibit points of view which you may have not regarded.</p>
		<p>Live within your income, however sinall. Do not be tempted by smooth offers of assistance to borrow from ostensible altruists with money to spare. These kind gentlemen are not usually actuated by motives of pure charity. Resist all temptation to extravagance even to the extent of defying custom. Indebtedness is a most potent source of unhappiness and social disaster. To allow yourselves to be dragged down by it through carelessness or weakness is nothing short of a social crime, affecting not only yourselves and your unfortunate dependants tut society in general.</p>
		<p>Finally, be mindful of the condition of those less fortunately situated than yourselves, the humble toilers in field and factory by whose efforts you have been enabled to reach the stage we celebrate today. Your education has been bought largely by the labour of such and they have accordingly a right to profit by it. You must therefore clearly understand that you owe to them the duty of striving all your days for their spiritual, social and material betterment. While universities are swelling and multiplying, the per﻿ centage of illiterates in this great land remains almost stationary, a standing reproach to every one of the hundreds of graduates turned out at each University Convocation. Although it may be placing what ought to be an absolute obligation on a lower plane, it is sufficiently obvious that in saving these you would be saving your own class. In any organized society constituted of different classes each is, in the last analysis, employed by the others. The true reason of the present difficulty of finding employment for the more cultured in India is that the less cultured are not in a position to take advantage of their services. The amelioration of social conditions below is necessary in order to create the national resource for the support of those above. Unless the evil circle of ignorance and economic distress can be broken the country is without hope.</p>
		<p>These are serious thoughts, but this is a serious occasion, not one entirely for jubilation at having over-leaped the last barrier of examination, but one also for the framing of resolutions, the excogitation of a plan of life, even, I hope, for a measure of selfdedication to the service of our fellows. Like a good host parting from welcome guests it is my duty in opening the gate into the world to point out to you your path. In doing so I bid you farewell and wish for you that your journey may be pleasant and your errand honourable and that you may in due time reach your destination in happiness and peace.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">YOUR HIGHNESS, MR. VICE-CHANCELLOR,<br />GRADUATES OF THE YEAR, LADIES AND<br />GENTLEMEN:</h1>
		<p> I am deeply and sincerely thankful to your Highness, the Chancellor of the University, for your gracious invitation to me to deliver the Convocation address to the graduates of the year. I accepted the invitation as in duty bound, but not without diffidence and hesitation. I am not an educational expert. I can only speak as a layman. I am a layman deeply interested in educational problems. Though I have had some connection with two Universities, I have no pretensions to an intimate or deep knowledge of Universities in general, or of the working of your University in particular, such as your Vice-Chancellor may claim. My knowledge of Mysore is confined to its law courts. It extends over thirty-three years; during twentyfive years of that period I have been an Advocate first of your Chief Court and then of the High Court. As Advocate I have even participated in Mysore elections. That however, is by the way.</p>
		<p>The Mysore University is just twenty-one years old. Mysore took a momentous decision when she decided to have a University of her own with the object, expressed by the Chancellor at its opening, of having a teaching University in which a full-time Vice-Chancellor and professors and teachers and students should be brought-into intimate daily association. With your two centres﻿ separated by some ninety miles, your University could not be strictly unitary. Mysore and Bangalore hold an indispensable place in the life of the State. And both had developed, in the course of the history of Mysore. The close approximation to the unitary type that you achieved has influenced later university developments in South India.</p>
		<p>Universities in Indian States are a distinct advantage. With their greater freedom to make experiments they can furnish guidance to British Indian Universities. The opposite sometimes happens—that they take over the features of British Indian legislation. I hope it will be permissible for me to express the opinion that your University Regulation of 1933 and the Madras University Act of 1923 have alike allowed what is of questionable policy, the intrusion of political influences into the acadenric world of the University.</p>
		<p>There is one question of general importance which Mysore is in a position to pronounce upon in the light of her individual experience-if not for her own guidance, at least for the guidance of future planners of Indian Universities. Is there any disadvantage in the dissociation between the hunanities and the sciences in their location? Mysore and Bangalore have alike languages, but mathematics, history, economics and politics and sociology, psychology and philosophy on the one side and physics, chemistry and mathematics and botany and zoology on the other, stand separately in the two centres, It is the intimate association involved in the corporate life of the University that supplies the corrective to the narrowness and the deficiencies of specialisation and one-sided study. A student﻿ benefits not merely by his own studies but also by the studies and temperainental diversities of other students and the general atmosphere that all help to create. Mysore with its two centres and the division of studies between them is in a position to say whether there is no disadvantage in the separation.</p>
		<p class="text-center">TECHNOLOGY, LAW AND MEDICINE.</p>
		<p>The promotion of technological studies is included among the objects of the universities in the more recent University Acts and in your own Regulation of 1933. Your progress in this new direction will be watched with interest. You have the most favourable conditions in the fact that your State is industrially well organised and developed.</p>
		<p>I understand you have decided not to have a Law College. I will not say that it is not a wellconsidered or wise decision. I can understand a desire not to add to an over-crowded profession. Law as a scientific study, however, is worthy of a place in liberal education. It deserves consideration whether scientific study of law and legal institutions should not have a place among the options for the B.A. Examination. Such studies exist in Oxford and they do not lead to law as a profession.</p>
		<p>I add my voice to Mr. Chintamani's in claiining your attention to the Ayur-Vedic and Unani systems of medicine. Miraculous cures effected by the practitioners of these systems are not negligible. They indicate that serious investigation is called for and it will not do to dismiss them as mere quakery. The scientific study of the systems and their improvement inay well engage the attention of enlightened Mysore.﻿</p>
		<p class="text-center">PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORTS.</p>
		<p>The importance of physical education cannot be over-estimated. But the devotion to sport has exceeded all reasonable bounds. In older times it would have been characterised as frivolous, if not a criminal, waste of time, but it is against all received opinion so to characterise it now. I have no doubt that all forms of recreation ought to be provided. I have myself belonged to the foot-ball. eleven in my college, though only for a short time. I have faith in regular exercise as a result of personal experience. It is an old belief attributed to Manu that physical exercise, apart from ordinary work and for the sake of exercise, is not advisable. The Kshatriyas were an exception to the rule. Probably, recreations in the field are organised somewhat on the same principle that the mind is not to be fixed on the physical evolutions performed. I not only do not object to exercise for exercise' sake but specifically advise it, adapted to individual needs. Club-swinging and the use of grip dumb bells and developers at a fixed hour of the day which many will feel and characterise as dreary were my self-imposed discipline for years. I have attended foot-ball and cricket matches now and then with interest, but the pages of the newspapers devoted to the sports news and the incessant talk of young fellows at home and outside about the cricket and tennis players in distant lands have produced and accentuated the feeling of protest in my mind. A young friend told me that I should watch rugby foot-ball to realise the value of sports in rousing latent strength. I dare say there is truth in the statement. But the devotion to sport﻿ in which one does not take part and the time spent in discussing it are far too much. In any case, I have had my say in the presence of a distinguished university audience. I can leave it to them to consider and deal with it as they like.</p>
		<p class="text-center">WOMEN'S EDUCATION.</p>
		<p>Ideals as to the education of women will always vary. There is a fair volume of opinion in favour of the view that collegiate education is an unnecessary luxury for women and that it injures their health and unfits them for family life which most of them must enter. - Girls in the villages are sturdier and the training in household work builds up their health and capacity sooner and better. All this may be true. There is an opinion which I share that college girls have effected an adjustment and they show an improved health in this generation. The number of women taking to collegiate education will always be fewer than the men. It must be left to them and to their guardians to decide whether they should go into the University or not. There ought to be no barriers erected against their entry into the University. The downward career of Indian women began when we abolished initiation and study of sacred literature in the case of women and classed them with those to whom it was never open. There are women hymn-makers in the Rig Veda, but no woman in later times may read the Veda: There are no modern. Maitreyis. There are the Webbs, the Hammonds, the Rhys Davidses and the Curies in other lands. The contribution of the women in some of these partnerships is deemed more valuable﻿ than that of the men. The women are not in all these cases products of the University, though their books are studied there. The highest study can be achieved without going into the University, but entry into University should not be refused on account of sex any more than that it should be refused on grounds of caste, class or creed.</p>
		<p class="text-center">MOTHER TONGUE.</p>
		<p>We have discussed often enough the question of the medium of instruction and are still discussing it. The problem of the mother tongue as the container and disseminator of all knowledge is a much larger problem. The language of a people is the measure of the knowledge and culture of that people. It is to this latter aspect that I wish to draw your attention.</p>
		<p>I am not among those who believe that the system of education inaugurated in 1835 and developed in the course of the century was an unredeemed failure. It is futile to speculate what we should have been if the opposite school had won in 1835. "It is conceivable that we should have been worse. I believe, and have always believed, that to a student desirous of extracting the best results out of it and prepared to bestow the necessary attention and labour under the guidance of competent teachers, the system was not incapable of yielding good results. I have personally nothing but a sense of gratitude for the benefit received. Most persons who condemn it now are among the best products of that system. It has done its work well enough, if not as well as it was expected to do. This need not, however, blind us to the inherent weaknesses of a﻿ system of education carried out in a foreign tongue. We are familiar with them. There is first the labour wasted in the acquisition of that language during the plastic years of life which ought to be devoted to the acquisition of knowledge. There is next the barrier that it creates between the educated classes and the masses. The free dissemination of the acquired knowledge is not assisted but hindered by it. The evil has a tendency to · perpetuate itself. Added to all this, the lure of Government employment and the attraction of examinations and degrees as mere passports to it have in them an element of demoralisation. The question is whether we visualise a time when the mother tongue should become the vehicle of thought in all departments of national life and should cover the whole field of knowledge. No people truly possess the knowledge that their language cannot, or does not, contain. Thought that is the possession of a class and not incorporated in the current language of the people is not the possession of the people. The body of thought and knowledge and the words conveying them have an intimate and inseparable relation, as Kalidasa. points out in the opening benedictory verse of his immortal 'Raghuvamsa'.</p>
		<p>National pride and national self-respect, of which we talk so much in other spheres, cannot allow us to acquiesce in the view that for all time knowledge imparted in our universities can only be imparted through English and therefore will be available only to those who consent to a preliminary acquisition of that language. I have before now had occasion to refer to the fact that Germany re﻿placed Latin as the instrument of higher thought by German and it became the language of Goethe and Schiller and of German philosophy and metaphysics in a century or a century and a half. Latin in Europe and Sanskrit in India were not foreign tongues and even they have had to be displaced, in order that learning may not be confined to a class. The use of a living foreign tongue as a means of education has more demoralising consequences. Nothing less than a complete replacement will make of the mother tongue an efficient instrument of national culture in all departments of national life and yet the obstacles in the way of making it such an instrument are very great, appallingly great and almost insuperable. Even in a place like Mysore where the destiny of the people is apparently in their own hands, the obstacles are only a little less.</p>
		<p>In British India all public activities are carried on in English English is the language of the Government, of the Courts and of the legislatures. Accounts and correspondence are maintained in English for the obvious conveniences of the course. Public meetings are held in English as the people have different home languages. Even in Mysore these conditions exist. The fact that half a century before the rendition, Mysore was under British administration has had its own consequences. I am glad to note that Mysore has, nevertheless, been able to change all this in the High School. The colleges and the universities still use English. I expect that Mysore visualises a time when education in all spheres will be in the Kannada language. It may be that, when that day comes,﻿ we cannot dispense with English altogether. We need not dispense with it. It will be the most important European language that could be taken as an optional language of study and many will choose it. Provision should be made for its teaching as well as for the teaching of French and German.</p>
		<p>The conveniences of the immediate present pull us one way and the demands of the future that we visualise point the other way. The solution, though it will be delayed, cannot be in doubt. We require determined thinkers and administrators to devise a programme of ways and means to appropriate the whole body of modern knowledge and incorporate it in the language of the people. I know it is a long way. It is not the work of a decade or two. It must be strenuous work spread over a long period. I wish only to add that in Russia, with its problem of many languages not dissimilar to India's, education is carried on in the language of the locality and the necessary literature has been created within a very short period. Given the desire and determination, it may be carried out sooner than we, in the light of our past, anticipate. The Vedic idea even of God's creation involves the three stages of "Intense desire to create, an intense and mighty effort, and creation". It may be quick or slow according to the nature of the creative work and the strength of the efforts put forth. The quickest creation may still require an irreducible minimum of time.</p>
		<p class="text-center">EDUCATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION.</p>
		<p>Reconstruction of education is just now a widely discussed topic. Reconstruction may often be a coming back. Not exactly to the point left behind, because there is no coming back in that sense in human history. We come back to the basic principles but with a different application to the changed circumstances that the intervening time and events have brought about. If I am anxious to exhibit the ancient unchanged core of principle, it is because I am anxious to point out that the builders of the future have not to scrap the past.</p>
		<p>The content of education may vary, nay, must necessarily vary, but the broad conception is common. Education is the discipline and development of faculty by the imparting of knowledge. There is a certain minimum of knowledge that must be imparted to all. This included reading, writing and arithmetic in all pial schools. In addition, each man must receive the training and discipline that is necessary for the place in the social economy that he is to occupy. This was done within the villages in most cases and often within the family. To those who are to acquire and impart higher knowledge and are to be, in various ways, guides and leaders of the community, there is to be higher education.</p>
		<p>The development aimed at is not one-sided. It must be an all-round education. It must make a man, a whole man, complete physically, mentally, morally and spiritually. Every one must be enabled to realise the highest or the best of which he is capable. The limit is set only by the capacity of the individual. This was always the theory but social conditions circumscribed opportunity. Ability that nothing could repress always transcended limitations and restrictions.﻿</p>
		<p>The names elenrentary, secondary and university education are modern, but the things they indicațe are of all times. The pial schools have been replaced by the modern elementary school. The projected vocational schools will not abolish hereditary craftsmanship, which would also require to be revived and encouraged. The Universities are a proper instrument of higher learning, though they need not supersede other institutions of oriental learning. Education from the elementary to the most advanced stages must, and did, cover the whole field of knowledge. This knowledge was never conceived as stationary or as a definite quantity. It was added to from generation to generation. Each generation received it from the predecessor and with such additions as it was able to make, passed it on to its successor. Institutions calculated to impart knowledge in all the three grades always existed. But literature naturally dealt with that which concerns the higher stages of education. And the references to lower education are simply left at the statement that those at the helm of affairs should devise ways and means for work and livelihood for all. Those who 'were engaged in this higher work were treated as the custodians of the higher learning and culture of the race. In ancient theocratic societies, custom and prejudice restricted access to the sacred texts embodying the higher learning to a particular class. But the learning itself was not treated as sealed to any class.</p>
		<p>The description thus given may alike apply to education, ancient or modern, and with the necessary changes in content and method involved in the﻿ process of time, the essential identity of conception may easily be recognised.</p>
		<p>The ideal of education was first sanctified in ancient India as a debt owed to the intellectual guardians of the community. The best definitions. of the words 'education' and 'university' cannot carry the matter beyond the conception of generations past, present and future as engaged in the common enterprise of preserving, augmenting and passing on the intellectual heritage of the race for ever and ever. In fact, it is a marvel how the higher knowledge and wisdom permeated all ranks of society and informed and influenced them in their daily lives.</p>
		<p>Universities were not unknown in ancient India. The old Universities were places of disinterested learning and attracted pupils not only from all parts of India but from distant China and Japan. Even in the days anterior to these Universities, learning was pursued under great teachers in what we now claim to be the university spirit, if not with all the paraphernalia of a modern University. For understanding the spirit of dedication involved in the sacred learning of an ancient student, one has only to turn to the book of the Taittiriyas, which in its solemn sonorously intoned text has a high lifting quality.</p>
		<p>Devotion to truth and right in the largest sense, a simple and austere life suited to the great purpose on which the student is engaged, self-restraint and tranquillity of mind, are prescribed; with and alongside of each of these requirements is repeated the injunction of unswerving adherence to the cardinal﻿ duty of deep study and dissemination of knowledge,</p>
		<p class="verse">ऋतं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च ।<br />सत्यं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च ॥<br />तपश्चस्वाध्यायप्रवचने च ।<br />दमश्चस्वाध्यायप्रवचने च ॥<br />शमश्चस्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । </p>
		<p>Curiously enough, differences of stress on these virtues by different preceptors are mentioned, evidencing the high seriousness with which education was pursued. "Truth in all things is the one thing needful”, says one teacher who came to acquire the surname of 'True-word'. "No! Austerity”, says another who came to be known as 'Ever-austere'. "Just learning and teaching, that is, <em>tapas,</em> real <em>tapas",</em> says a third.</p>
		<p class="verse">सत्यमिति सत्यवचाराथीतरः ।<br /> तप इति तपोनित्यः पौरुशिष्टिः ।<br /> स्वाध्यायप्रवचने एवेति नाको मौद्गल्यः ।<br /> तद्धि तर्पस्तद्धितपः ।</p>
		<p>The parting injunction of the teacher to the pupil at the close of his education again lays stress on truth and right and learning and teaching, warns against the neglect of material welfare and prosperity and enjoins a well-ordered life following in the wake of thoughtful, high-souled men, tenderhearted and moved only by righteousness.</p>
		<p>स्वाध्यायान्माप्रमदः ।</p>
		<p>सत्यान्नप्रमदितव्यम् ।﻿</p>
		<p class="verse">धर्मान्नप्रमदितव्यम् ।<br /> कुशलान्नप्रमदितव्यम् ।<br />। भूत्यैनप्रमदितव्यम् ।<br />। स्वाध्यायप्रवचनाभ्यां नप्रमदितव्यं ।</p>
		<p class="verse">येतत्रब्राह्मणाः संमर्शिनः ।<br /> युक्ता आयुक्ताः ।<br />अलूक्षा धर्माकामाः स्युः<br /> यथा ते तत्र वर्तेरन् ।<br /> तथा तत्र वर्तेथाः ।</p>
		<p>The high ideals of life that animated these ancient teachers and pupils in their study and conduct are still worthy of emulation. The actual content of their study may have been different, but the spirit behind it was not inferior to anything that we know or exhibit to-day in our own lives. In the too eager pursuit of the much lower advantages of wealth and power we have lost sight of some of the ideals and virtues of an earlier time. Even the presenti need for reconstructing our educational system is in large part due to the fact that we have rushed in in too large numbers, not for the discipline and its value, but for the resulting degree measured in terms of money,</p>
		<p>I have heard the criticism that education in ancient India was mere memorising and that it was not <em>education</em> in the real sense. I feel that the criticism is hardly just to these ancient teachers. The same book of the Taittiriyas bears witness to their conception of teaching the higher pupil. Every time the pupil returned with a partial, inade﻿quate solution the teacher sent him back with the direction to go and reflect again until, having found the solution after many trials and being satisfied, the pupil did not return again. He was made to solve the problem for himself.</p>
		<p>The whole of our national history is a refutation of the charge that our study was uncritical and futite. It is an opinion that may be passed with some amount of justice on more recent times. The vision of India down the ages, from the days of the Rishis to our own time with its Buddha and Mahavira, Valmiki and Vyasa, Panini and Patanjali, Manu and Yajnavalkya, Jaimini, Sahara, and Kumarila and Sankara, Ramanuja and Madhva, to mention only a few names at random, must dispel the idea that our education has been a mere burden to the memory and not a process of life and growth. When the night came on, and we no longer added to our knowledge, we still retained the old disciplines and preserved the old heritage, and in the capacity we have shown in acquiring modern knowledge, we have proof that the ancient discipline and spirit are still alive, in abundant measure.</p>
		<p>As I began with the educational reconstruction now under discussion, I must say a word about it. There is fair unanimity on the general outlines of the solution, though there may be differences in detail. From à lucid note of your Vice-Chancellor on 'Education in Mysore', I find you had a Committee on the subject and their recommendations have been made. When the Madras proposals were made, the first reaction was the suspicion that the attempt was to-stifle or restrict higher education. I have information that that view still prevails in﻿ some quarters and even among some educationists. I personally think that restriction of admission to Universities is, to some extent necessary and a corresponding change in secondary education is also necessary. The real difficulty is in discriminating between those who should go into vocations and those who ought to go into Universities and in persuading a student or his guardian to recognise facts and make a wise choice. Much tact and judgment and a certain flexibility in applying the rules to border-line cases will be required of the administrator. Otherwise, Newtons may stand excluded from the Universities. However beneficial these changes may be, the exclusion from colleges should not begin before the 'vocational courses into which the students are to be diverted are ready to be put in operation. Much friction and dislocation will be averted if the proposals are taken as a whole and brought into operation at one and the same time.</p>
		<p>Graduates of the University, I offer you my hearty felicitations on the completion of your prescribed studies and the attainment of your respective degrees. Traditional usage prescribes an exhortation to the graduates on the day of the Convocation to conduct themselves suitably unto the position, to which, by the degrees conferred on them, they have attained. During the whole of your life in the University, there has been a continuous, unspoken exhortation to you to imbibe the ideals of the University and shape your lives in the light of such ideals. An exhortation to you to-day to live up to the great ideals in which you have been brought up is only a formal reminder﻿ on a ceremonial occasion. Some of you may pursue further studies, but many will pass out of the portals of the University into the wider world beyond, in quest of your life-work. I wish you all, men and women alike, every success in your quest. A great and enlightened Ruler, who has earned admiration in and outside the State, and his wise and able Diwan preside over the destiny of Mysore. The industrial and economic development and prosperity they have achieved for the State place you here perhaps in a better position than graduates elsewhere. But there is even here some apprehension of unemployment. I find your Vice-Chancellor referring in his note to . unemployment even of women graduates. Conditions were far easier in my time and yet I remember the feeling of bewilderment at having to face an adverse world. Things are much worse now. Trials and tribulations there may be. Face the world with courage and do the work that falls to your lot with all the energy that you can put into it. Strive to make the best of life. "Strive for prosperity" as the <em>Upanishad</em> enjoins. But do not pitch your hopes and expectations too high. I should have said that to you in the best of circumstances. I should say it particularly in the difficult times in which we live. Take what comes to you. Do not lose heart over unfulfilled expectations. This is in regard to yourselves.</p>
		<p>And the society, in the midst of which we live, is passing through difficult times. Intolerance is their peculiar characteristic. In comparatively tolerant times and countries, rival ideas held their own ground, but in the sphere of﻿ action reached some kind of working reconciliation and harmony. There was no attempt to suppress and extinguish rival ideas or those who espoused them. Europe is now inculcating a new lesson. If a view is earnestly, solemnly, sincerely held, it cannot give quarter to its opposite and those that represent that view cannot tolerate their opponents. Each party then must not only capture power but must not allow the opposite view or its exponents to lift up their head. Where neither party has won or can win so as to crush its opponent out of existence, the country can only be in a state of civil war divided between the two camps. Even when national affairs have been adjusted you cannot feel safe so long as there is a neighbouring country with the opposite principle and party in power. Every country is in dread as to what revolution may overtake it either at the instance of dissatisfied classes within or at the instigation of a neighbouring power without. Even in countries where open class conflict does not exist, the equilibrium is more or less unstable and elements of conflict, seen or unseen, exist. No one can say that the problem of class conflict has received a solution in Europe that we can straightaway adopt as a solution for our troubles here. We here, far away in India, live perhaps a sheltered existence. And you in Mysore are doubly sheltered. But we have the same types of men among us, within your frontiers and without. Some are ranged on one side, owing spiritual allegiance to one set of ideas, and some on the other side, owing allegiance to the opposite set of ideas. And the inequalities of life and opportunity from which﻿ these mortal rivalries ultimately spring exist here as in other countries. We must deal with these social maladies, or le consequence will be serious. A good section of those who think on these matters and count for much in the country take the view that neither fascism nor communisın is consistent with the genius of our race and the social system we have evolved in the course of millennia, and that neither can be the real solution for our ills. But the real solution must be a modification of our social system in which individual initiative is not, but unrestricted competition is, eliminated and equality of opportunity is promoted by the removal of the crying abuses and evils that now exist.</p>
		<p>Those that are now. in political power have associations that exert disturbing influences on the course of legislation and administration. This is applicable in a greater measure to us in British India than to you in an Indian State. In the remarks I am here making as to your part, I make no distinction between you and us, remembering that ideas and ideals have no frontiers to detain them and what is our problem to-day may be yours to-morrow. Leadership naturally belongs to you who go out of the Universities. The duty of deep study and dissemination of sound ideas laid by our ancients, on those who have received higher education gains this new application in your case in the circumstances of our time. There will always be those to whom the ancient wisdom is the final word and not even when the circumstances change can there be any the slightest change in established institutions. There will be also those to whom the experience and wisdom of ages are﻿ but foolishness and the unknown, whatever the risk, has an attraction and revolutionary changes are welcome as adventures into the unknown. It will be your part to strike the sane middle path, to move the immobile conservative and restrain the inpatient revolutionary. Farewell.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS<br />BY REV. C. F. ANDREWS, AT THE CONVOCATION<br />OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MYSORE; ON THE <br />6TH OCTOBER 1938.</h1>	
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESS, VICE-CHANCELLOR AND FELLOW STUDENTS,</p>
		<p>THE critical years that are in front of us compel me to employ every moment of my time on matters of primary importance and you will forgive to-day the omission of any formal opening.</p>
		<p>We live in a distracted world which is passing through a hurricane of evil. The cyclone has swept from one end of the earth to the other. In the Far East, Japan has invaded China, and an incredibly cruel war has been carried on with ruthless ferocit for over a year. In the west of Europe, Spain, has been torn asunder by a struggle that is no less deadly. Day after day we look at the news in the papers concerning Central Europe in order to see whether war has broken out or not. Even as I write these words, on September 15th, the telegrams are full of dread forebodlings. It will not do for us in India to say with Hamlet,</p>
		<p class="verse">The world is out of joint. O cursed spite!<br />That ever I was born to set it right! </p>
		<p>For we <em>must</em>seek the deeper causes of the evil within ourselves. Otherwise we, too, in our turn, may be﻿ brought within the hurricane zone. While therefore, I shall only deal to-day with those urgent and pressing questions which touch us here in India, I shall keep in mind all the while this vast and sinister background of world disorder which we cannot altogether escape.</p>
		<p>Many of those who have just taken their degrees will have their share very soon in shaping the destiny of Mysore State, to which they will devote their service. This University should be in a position to provide one of the chief sources of their deep and solid thinking. I would ask them, together with those present, to do some of this hard thinking along with me today; for the subject I have chosen-how to bridge over the gulf between the rich and the poor; between the University and the villages, --is by far the most difficult that we can approach. Only that State, which can set to work sincerely to solve this problem, is likely to weather the storm. We have lately witnessed, in Europe, how ancient dynasties, that did nothing to help the poor, have crashed. Here in India we have begun to realize how near the danger may be to ourselves, and how short is the time for putting our own house in order. If I keep strictly, as I am bound to da, to the academic aspect of my subject, the importance of the political issue will not be forgotten. Pure science is the basis of all applied science. So what I try to put forward. in principle this morning lies at the back of that ferment in Indian politics which is leavening our national life.</p>
		<p>First of all, let us frankly acknowledge, that in spite of much that has been harmful, great benefits﻿  have come to India through its long association with the West. The hard, stern,'exact, scientific thinking of modern Europe has brought this country, with a shock, out of its ancient fairy land of dreams. To take a concrete example, which every historian would accept, the impenetrable wall of untouchability was breached at last in the nineteenth century by the terrific impact of Western scientific and dennocratic thought. The wrong to womanhood, caused by child marriage, has also been brought home to the conscience of India in a similar manner. The present successful movement for social reform goes back to the liberal ideas of Gladstone and Bright, of Mazzini and Abraham Lincoln, as well as to the insight of the great Indian reform leaders, beginning with Raja Ram Mohan Roy and ending with Malatina Gandhi.</p>
		<p>The West has reaped its own benefits in return, Perhaps the greatest has been the recovery of the immensely potent conception of one Spirit pervading Man and Nature. We can trace the effect of this quite early. The vast intellect of Goethe first hailed it from afar. Wordsworth, in his own ruggedly independent way, worked out its inner meaning. Shelley felt it also in his eager spirit. The more directly Indian contact is seen in Emerson and Walt Whitman. The full effect was shown in 1912, hy thie remarkable reception given to Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali.' This small book was translated into all the languages of the West, and had, perhaps, its greatest influence in America,</p>
		<p>It is true that the World War swept this aside for the time being, and a crude, intransigent theology﻿ has succeeded, especially in Central Europe. But already the pendulum has swung back, and astronomers like Eddington and Jeans are revealing to us a renewed desire to approach this a venue of the Spirit along which our mysterious universe may be explored.</p>
		<p>A further influence, which we all recognise in our own day, has been that of Mahatma Gandhi, who has shown us in the West, in part at least, a way out of our modern chaos by putting into practice the vital principle of pure non-violence in face of a world filled with violence and untruth. This very year, I was invited to go over to Europe, and also to America, for the sole purpose of setting before the most earnest thinkers in both continents the great principles in action for which Mahatma Gandhi stands.</p>
		<p>So far then we may assert, historically, that benefits have accrued on both sides from this closer contact between East and West.</p>
		<p>But in India, owing to political domination, there have also been injurious features which need to be eliminated. Let me explain by typical examples some of these evils.</p>
		<p>When I was teaching in the Punjab University more than thirty years ago, by far the greater proportion of those whom I taught came originally from the villages. They were the best brains in that. generation. But I can hardly remember a single instance of one who went back to his own village in order to﻿  work for his village people. His English education had cut him off from his own kith and kin. Thus the fact became glaringly evident to me long ago, that the villages were being depleted of their best intellects in order to feed the elaburate machine by which the administration was being kept going.</p>
		<p>A further fact struck me at once with dismay. I could not get a single student, who was living with me in our hostel, to speak to me in any other language but English. This was not due to any want of effort on my part. For I used to try very hard to speak to them in my own broken Urdu and Hindi, because I longed to be able to converse fluently in these two Indian languages; but the invariable result was that they answered me back in English, because their one desire was to learn English as rapidly as possible.</p>
		<p>One more story may be mentioned. Once upon a time, in South India, I was asked to speak at an Old Students' gathering. The first thing that I noticed was the imitation of European methods in almost everything that was done. With a view to counteract this, I quite innocently suggested to the President that he should make his closing remarks in Tamil, which was his own mother-tongue. But when he got up on his feet and tried to do so, he completely broke down and had to finish his speech in English. He acknowledged to me afterwards, with noble shame, that there was something strangely wrong with his education, when he could not speak even his own mother-tongue correctly</p>
		<p>Thus two very disturbing features came early to my notice. One was the manner in which the best intellectual life was being drained out of the villages into the towns. The second was that English had become nothing less than a craze and an obsession.</p>
		<p>It must be remembered that these things about which I am speaking occurred many years ago. Mahatma Gandhi had not come back from South Africa, and the National Movement had not swept over the whole country, like a purifying flood, clearing away the debris. Yet, in spite of all that has happened since, the divorce between the University and the village has by no means been set right. The English-educated still shun the village life and tend to become congested in the towns. Unemployment among them is increasing.</p>
		<p>If I am asked impatiently whether the English language should be abandoned altogether, I should at once answer, 'No.' For, as I have shown, it has had its own valuable uses. It has been the solvent, through its literature, of some of India's worst evils. It has also welded together, as nothing else could have done at the time, the diverse parts of India. Still further, it has brought India into touch with the vast outer world of thought where English is commonly spoken.</p>
		<p>But now, this earlier phase is nearly over. English will still be taught, but it must no longer be the <em>medium of instruction.</em> That should, in future, always be the mother-tongue. Indian teachers must﻿  use the mother-tongue when they teach geography, history and mathematics;' they must no longer employ the medium of English. I have used the imperative word 'must,' because I have no doubt whatever that this step has at once to be taken.</p>
		<p>Very soon, we may hope that the State will follow the example of the University and use the mother-tongue both in the Law Courts and in Governmeut offices. Then we shall witness some of the best results of this important change, whereby a true independence will be reached by Indian manhood and womanhood, and one of the greatest barriers between the village and the University will be demolished.</p>
		<p>It may be asked why I have spent so much time on this language problem. I have done so, because the critical moment has arrived to urge that in Mysore University itself this whole subject of the medium of instruction should be thought out in a scientific manner, and steps taken to put things right. Mysore State is admirably adapted for this, because it is almost completely a one language area.</p>
		<p>I would ask one very simple and obvious question: Is there any other country in the world except India where instruction is given from the school stage right up to the University through the medium of a foreign language? Personally, I cannot recall a single instance, nor can I remember any area, where the gulf has become so wide between the educated classes and the village people.﻿</p>
		<p>But the harm done by this foreign medium has gone far beyond the sphere of language and education. It has invaded other sides of life as well. Perhaps the most injurious has been the continual rise in the cost of living, without any compensating benefit to the common people. Artificial needs have been created by the rush of foreign articles into the market and these have ousted the homely things made by our own people. In this manner the old industries of the villages, one by one, have been destroyed.</p>
		<p>It has become a common place to note how this has happened with regard to Lancashire cloth. Mahatma Gandhi had drilled into us the bad effect of such foreign expenditure. But the damage done has by no means stopped at articles of clothing It has gone on to cover almost everything we usè down to the smallest details of every day life:</p>
		<p>I remember, long ago, the first occasion when I went down the Chandni Chowk at Delhi, in order to get some India-made things to send home as a gift to my sisters. To my horror, I found that every shop was full of cheap and tawdry foreign manufactured goods, which had been sent out by ship to India. Mr. Rudra, who was with me, had to take me down some side street before he could find a shop where I could obtain genuine handmade Indian goods. The injury done by such a one-sided process of trade - has to be carefully noted. Those things which are ex ported to England, in exchange for these foreign manufactured articles, are taken out of the Indian soil in one way or another. That is to say, the raw﻿ products of India have been diminished in order to receive in exchange these goods from abroad. We have been diminishing instead of increasing our food values.</p>
		<p>This process of deterioration has to be gradually reversed. The nutrition which comes from Indian agriculture and husbandry must be conserved. Whatever articles of dress or furniture are needed must as far as possible be produced in India itself. Only in this way can the life blood of the Indian villages flow freely again and some prosperity return to those who are now living almost below the level of subsistence.</p>
		<p>I have noticed with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction, as I have gone about the country, in Mysore State, that already industrial power through electricity has been spread to many village areas. Handicrafts have been revived in country districts. What I am, therefore, urging this morning is nothing new to Mysore. For under H. H. the Maharajah and the Dewan, who have this so much at heart, the State has already begun to show a wholesome change in this direction such as I have not seen in any other part of India. My point is that now is the most critical time for a further step forward to be made. A general movement is needed, all over India, far in advance of anything that has been seen hitherto. A silent peaceful revolution is required, if violent changes are to be avoided.</p>
		<p>We come now to the last evil that needs to be entirely swept away. Hitherto, as we have seen, an﻿ inferior imitation of the West has been the uninspiring aim set before us. This has left behind it what Mahatma Gandhi has rightly called a "slave mentality .' With mighty blows, he has broken the chain which bound us fast with this strange mental subjection. The general effect of his appeal throughout the country has already been amazing; and yet in the Universities themselves a cautious conservatism still holds sway which is desperately hard to break. Here, in the Universities, has been the stronghold of this Western obsession; and therefore I welcome this morning an opportunity of striking another blow for freedom.</p>
		<p>I know that, in doing so I have with me the hearts of all who are young and of many also who are old. But I would repeat again and again, we are not living to-day in a normal world. The time is short. We have already passed through one world war, in a single generation, and are on the brink of another. Therefore, in these matters, we must aim at a radical change of heart, which must be nothing less than drastic; for we have to keep pace with the crisis in the midst of which we are living. We cannot go on in an easy, slip-shod manner, while the whole world around us is aflame. The revolution has come to our own doors. We have to appeal to the power of sacrifice in the heart of youth to make a supreme effort; and if we do this, we must be ready for sacrifices ourselves. The older generation must not throw the whole burden on the young.</p>
		<p>A short time ago, I was talking over this whole subject with Swami Abinashananda, one of the oldest﻿ members of the Rainakrishna Mission. He said to ine, “I was born in a village and spent all iny boyhood there. My English education, in Madras, cut me off from my own village people. Only now in these later years, ag a Swami, have I been welcoined back again with open arms." "How well,” he continued, "I remember that village life! How dear it was to me! There was something precious in it, that we have almost lost to-day!"</p>
		<p>I asked him to tell me what this was, and he replied, “We truly loved one another and shared everything in cominon. But now we have lost this joy of followship. Another more selfisli spirit has entered. We, who are educated, have acquired new tastes and new habits, which have separated us from our own people. We hear a great deal about rural reconstruction nowadays, and this has its importance; but it is the old spirit of village <em>brotherhood</em> that needs most of all to be revived.<em>We have to come back, both to our faith in God, and to our trust in one another."</em></p>
		<p>His words, which were spoken with the deep sincerity of a man of religion, reminded me of my own early days at Cambridge nearly fifty years ago, when I too at one time began to feel acutely the change from my home surroundings owing to the new intellectual environment of the University. One thing saved me at that time from moral disaster. It was the touch I had with poor people. In the slums of South Kast London, among the very poorest, there was a College Settlement, where I could go down for a week end, or during the vacation, and live among﻿ those who were facing problems of suffering and poverty that were far harder to solve than mathematics. These poor people had kept their simple faith in God and they helped me to keep mine. Through my love for them, in the midst of all their hardships, so bravely borne, I was able to love God also. So, when my University days were over, this College Settlement, in the midst of the poor of South East London, became my home; and the most fruitful days in all my life were spent there learning to understand the needs and sufferings of the poor, I should never have understood India's poverty, if I had not lived thus as a poor man among the poor in my own country.</p>
		<p>My thoughts, therefore, have naturally been directed to this experience of poverty in my early days. For this drew me as with a magnet to the side of Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa, because it was clear to me in a moment that he had sacrificed everything for the cause of the poor. The same thoughts drew me also to Gurudeva, Rabindranath Tagore, who has for more than fifty years devoted himself with a heart full of love to the poverty-stricken villagers in his own province of Bengal.</p>
		<p>I have gone on to wonder, since coming to Mysore State, whether there might not be formed an A or Settlement not unlike what I have lived in at Santiniketan and also at Sabarmati and Wardha, --similar also to Kingsley Hall in the east end of London, where Mahatma Gandhi lived when he went over for the Round Table Conference. For even then he would﻿ rot losc touch with the poorest of the poor, and he found a home at Kingsley Hall, under the care of Muriel Lester, which was nearest to his heart's desire.</p>
		<p>It has bcen brought to my notice that students go out from this University to the villages; and I have seen the nucleus of a work, such as I contemplate, already started at Bangalore. But I am now asking for a much more extensive effort to be made. Might not there be an Asram or Settlement, directly connected with the University, with buildings of its own, where University graduates inight go who were determined to become one with the poor by sharing their hardships?</p>
		<p>A Town University Settlement of this kind would obviously be best established in the centre of the will area of Bangalore. It should not only undertake what might be called 'hospital work' by cleaning up the slun quarters, but should also be the home of carnest thinkers and workers who would throw in their lot with thie poor and be able to speak impartially for them in those big issues relating to the hours of work, the rate of wages, accident and sick insurance, maternity benefits, etc., which make all the difference in the lives of thousands of poor people. For while Mysore State can rightly be praised for its advanced labour legislation, as compared with other parts of India, yet the utmost vigilance is always noeded in these matters in order to see that the law is carried into effect. Only the voluntary efforts of non-officials, men of high character and impartial judgment, can convince the general public that the labourers are being justly treated.</p>
		<p>I have in mind another branch of the same University Asram or Settlement,--not in the town, but in the country. This second centre should be established in the very heart of the villages. Here again I contemplate something on a much larger scale than what has been attempted hitherto. My own vivid ideas have been shaped by what I have seen at Rabindranath Tagore's Asram, on its agricultural side at Sri-Niketan. At some spot, not far from Mysore, an Asram might be built up on the simplest lines, where men and women could go direct from the University, after their course was over, to live the country life and study at first hand the problems of the villages of Mysore. This should forin a kind of laboratory for some of the best and noblest thinkers in Mysore State.</p>
		<p>I know that any efforts of this kind, which might be made by University graduates and studerits, would have the warmest support of His Highness the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor, and also of the Dewan Sahib, whose sympathy with such a cause is known all over India. Nothing, I ain sure, would please the authorities more than a spontaneous effort made in this direction. It was with the greatest pleasure that I read that Sir Mirza Ismail, in his recent Convocation Address at Madras, had brought forward this same suggestion that I am making here to-day. The project is therefore in the air.<em> Why should not Mysore University be the first to realize it﻿ fully in a concrete form?</em>I have seen in Bangalore itself how a start has already been made. Could not this be continued ? If my Convocation Address had any influence in supporting the idea of such a University Settlement on a large scale this would give me the keenest pleasure.</p>
		<p>Let me outline for a moment what is in my mind." The Town Settlement would consist of a large Hostel built somewhere in the very midst of the poorest quarter of the city. It would have a Hall, where public meetings might be held, and a 'number of detached rooms, with a common kitchen, where those who were able to do so might take up their residence and share their meals together. Side by side with this, in another Hall, there would be a public Library and Reading Room where papers and books would be placed. This Library would be opened every evening for any one to come in freely. Night classes might be held there for various purposes. When funds permitted, a small cinema would be added for educational purposes. These buildings would be grouped round a garden in the centre, with flowering trees, which should be kept fresh and cool by means of a plentiful supply of water. It should have beds of flowers and green grass to delight the eye. This garden should be open to the public and form a place of pleasant shade and beauty in the hot sultry evenings at sunset. Those who might come into residence in such a Settlement should live in the plainest manner possible. They should be frugal and economical in their daily life so that the gulf between the rich and poor should not in any way invade the﻿ Settlement itself. Those who were still engaged in their University course might come down from time to time to live there along with others who were settled in as permanent residents.</p>
		<p>The expense incurred in food and establishment should be such as would satisfy the exacting requirements of Mahatma Gandhi hiraself, if he were able to visit the Settlement. I have gone into detail in order to niake the picture glow before you; for I have had in my own mind all the while the joy of such poverty among the poor which came into my own life, when, for some years, after my college days were over, I was given the charge of such a Settlement as I have described in one of the slums of London. As I have stated, the whole of my later life which I have spent here in India among the poor received its first impulse in those years when I lived in the same manner in London. They were not only the best, but also the most formative years that I have ever spent; for they shaped the whole of my life in this one direction.</p>
		<p>With regard to the second University Settlement among the villages of Mysore, it should include a dispensary and small hospital attached to it and also be made into a handicraft training centre for village boys who might afterwards go back to their own villages to practise what they had learnt.</p>
		<p>Further, young villagers should be taught, through classes at the Centre, how to improve the health conditions around them. A kindly and wholesome rivalry might be set up between the different﻿ villages which are near the University Settlement as to cleanliness, neatness, and beauty. Thus the Settlement itself would be a focus in the midst of the country for all kinds of training which might heļp the villagers to take a thoroughly genuine pride in their own surroundings.</p>
		<p>Through those who come for different purposes to the Centre, a close touch might be established between the villagers and the University, Settlement, so that there would be no difficulty for research workers, who come into residence, to pay personal visits to the villages where they would be welcome: As in the town Asram, the standard of living among the residents would have to be so simple that.no villager, who came to the Settlement, would feel out of place. Here again, the standard set by Mahatma Gandhi might be followed.</p>
		<p>By means of village fairs, or jatras, it should be possible to give some brightness and joy as well as training and instruction. Such village festivals have their great use in breaking through the monotony of ordinary-existence. They add happiness to village life and thus make people ready to stay in the country and not flock to the towns.</p>
		<p>I turn back again from homely, practical suggestions such as these to congratulate Mysore State on what has already been accomplished by its able administration in order to bring back prosperity to the villages and also to improve the mill areas in Bangalore. It will be in future the life-task of many﻿ here this morning, including one who may be called to take a princely part in it, to carry this progress still further forward. The highest statesmanship and integrity will be needed to continue what has been already accomplished with remarkable foresight.</p>
		<p>The ultimate goal is every day becoming clearer to those who are planning the future. That goal is to find some inexpensive means of harnessing the water power of Mysore State for the use of the villages and also of the poorer parts of the towns. If this can be done, it will help to bring all kinds of minor industries back into the country life as a whole, instead of concentrating them in the big cities. It will also make the cleaning up of the slums much more easily accomplished. The one hall-mark of success will lie in decentralization. It may not be too late to undertake in this manner State Socialism of the best type; to <em>spread </em>industry, rather than to concentrate it in one or two places. But, for this purpose, ardent enthusiasts will be needed, who love Mysore with all their hearts, and are ready to work night and day to make Mysore a model State, where the best ideals of India may be carried out on a princely scale with the cordial good-will of the people behind them.</p>
		<p>Hitherto, I have only spoken of outward prosperity; but there are other things that need to be brought into the villages which are even more important. "Man shall not live by bread alone." The old <em>mantram</em>of the Upanishads, "From joy all things proceed, in joy all things consist, unto joy all things return,' is as profound as it is true. What Swamiji﻿ told me the other day contains the secret of the best happiness and contentment. "How we used to love one another.” That was the inner joy which made men long to return to their own village after their education was over and made them even home-sick for it.</p>
		<p>"Our object should be," writes Tagore, "to try to food the choked bed of village life with the stream of happiness. For this, the scholars, the poets, the musicians, the artists, have to collaborate, to offer their contributions. It is fulness of <em>life</em> that makes one happy, not fulness' of purse."</p>
		<p>What Tagore means is that the villager needs inward happiness, peace, and contentment, as well as abundance of food; and it should be one of the chief functions of University Settlements of this kind to bring joy to the poor.</p>
		<p>Joy and Hope! The depression in our villages must cease. Hope must enter, so that Joy may abound. Only by the rich and poor, the University and the villages, coming closer into touch with one another, can this be accomplished, and Mysore remain a happy and prosperous State.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS<br />Delivered at the Convocation of the University<br />of Mysore, on the 30th September 1944, by<br /> Rajadharmapravina Diwan Bahadur<br />K. S. Chandrasekhara Aiyar</h1>			
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESS, GRADUATES OF THE YEAR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</p>
		<p> I FEEL grateful to His Highness the Maharaja, who I as Chancellor of this University bas entrusted to me a duty discharged on previous occasions by persóns so much more distinguished and competent. It is an honour to stand in the place from which they were wont to address those assembled in Convocation. And I cannot but prize an opportunity which enables me, at one and the same time, to pay a just tribute of admiration for the great and enduring work of the University, and to express my whole-hearted sympathy with the struggles and triumphs, the hopes and prospects, of the youthful seekers after knowledge, represented here by the candidates who have been admitted to:degrees.</p>
		<p>My own association with the Mysore University. goes back to its very early days, and has extended to several years of service on its Senate and Council and on a number of its Committees. The cessation of active connection has not by any means diminished my personal interest. So it is not by way of compliment, but to avow a conviction based on some acquaintance, that I affirm that the University of Mysore has amply justified the expectations with which it was founded. It is fulfilling with yearly accession of strength and efficiency the distinctive functions of a teaching and residential﻿ University for its own particular region. The distribution of studies among the constituent Colleges gives adequate effect to the unitary principle. The subjects taught cover a wide range, and lead to the important faculties of Arts, Science, Medicine, Engineering and Technology, and Commerce. The circle will be virtually completed when the addition of a faculty of Law, long under consideration, becomes an accomplished fact. Two separate Colleges, one of them of the first grade, serve the needs of women's education. Special encouragement is being given to the development of Kannada literature, and provision is made for publishing works of scholarship and for diffusing useful information by means of extension lectures. The fact, above all, that an increasing number of young persons are sent out through its portals, disciplined and qualified for the world's business, and that many of them have established themselves, often with marked distinction, in various walks of life, is in itself eloquent testimony to the valuable work of the University as the training ground of promising youth for high positions in public life.</p>
		<p>The University of Mysore has, in a brief period of twenty-eight years, established a reputation second to none as an advanced seat of modern learning and culture. It has helped to enhance the fame of Mysore as a State with a progressive outlook in the matter of higher education no less than in other respects. The people of Mysore may well feel proud of their University and of the position it has secured in the estimation of the intellectual world. They cannot but realize how much this gratifying result is due to the solicitude and co-operation of His Highness the Maharaja's Government, who have spared no effort, encouragement or expense to build up and sustain this great institution at the highest possible level. His Highness the Maharaja is himself a distinguished graduate of the University, and His Highness' guidance as  Chancellor and well-known personal interest in its work and development are matters of the happiest augury for the future.</p>
		<p>The volume of private endowments is large and growing, and now exceeds five lakhs of rupees in the aggregate. Several of them are for fairly substantial amounts, of or above ten thousand rupees, the latest addition being the Crawford Endowment of Rs. 55,000 for scholarships. Some are special endowments by former students, and a good many are made by the general public in order to encourage higher studies in specified subjects or among members of particular denominations. A few are devoted to general purposes, such as the publication of popular hand-books. Private munificence has not yet, to an appreciable extent, taken such forms as the founding of chairs for advanced teaching, the furtherance of higher research, and other objects closely connected with some of the main functions of the University.</p>
		<p>To the new recipients of degrees I offer very warm felicitations on the success they have achieved. Speaking to them collectively, I would say: The distinction which you have gained is a matter for legitimate satisfaction. It has been won in a fair field where birth and wealth confer no advantages, and considerations of caste and creed do not operate. Achievement here is the reward solely of merit, gained through hard study, perseverance and discipline, and then put to searching test and trial before being stamped with the approval and authority of the University.</p>
		<p>A certain proportion among you all will probably go in for further studies, special or professional. But the greater number have presumably completed that portion of your lives which you can afford to devote to 'academic pursuits, and are now looking forward to taking a share in some form or other of worldly affairs. None of you, I﻿ take it, is so simple as to imagine that, by passing the appointed examinations and obtaining the degrees and diplomas to which they give access, the education of a student is finished. True education never comes to an end. So long as a person is capable of growing in mind and character, so long will be need and be all the better for education, mainly of the kind which he can get by his own efforts. In your case, the taking of a degree marks the end of one stage of education, that of preparation for further steps that lie abead. A system of public education such as you have received has as its aim an all-round development of personality. It should have endowed you, not merely with a stock, of information, valuable no doubtin itself and even more as mental exercise, but with a real love of knowledge for its own sake, together with the power to select and to assimilate. It should bave awakened in you the soul of culture, as mirrored in an enlightened understanding and a refinement and deepening of nature. It should have formed and strengthened a character responsive to worthy and noble impulses and to those only. It should have helped to improve your physical health and stamina. In all such ways we are entitled to presume that the training, associations, and influences of your student days have formed a good foundation for your future life.</p>
		<p>Gathering up the varied advantages you have gained under the fostering care of your Alma Mater, you are, most of you, about to pass into a wider world where you will come under new conditions, which will impose unaccustomed duties and responsibilities, but also offer enlarged freedom and scope for talent and initiative. The subject of first interest to a young man about to start in life is naturally the search for a career. This, at all times a somewhat difficult matter, has in these later decades become increasingly hard. Wbile education, both secondary and higher, has made fairly rapid﻿ expansion, there has not been a corresponding increase in the available openings for the products of such education. Every avenue of employment, from Government service to the indep. udent professions, is or is on the way to become overcrowded. The development of trade and industry, till quite recently, has been too slow to absorb more than a very small percentage of the qualified unemployed.</p>
		<p>In most countries it is coming to be recognized that large scale unemployment is a very grave social evil, which can only be effectively tackled by the full use of the authority and resources of the State. To fit educated youth with appropriate occupation has always been a ratber perplexing task. In the peculiar circumstances of India it is one of special urgency and importance. The intelligence and energy of young manhood must have sufficient and suitable outlet. If legitiinate openings are denied, then the temptation to follow out rash and reckless courses may prove difficult to resist.</p>
		<p>There are people who, lamenting what they regard as the over-production of graduates, would counter the phenomenon by making education more costly and difficult, especially in its higher grades. A few would not hesitate to restrict admission to schools and colleges in drastic ways, leaving the disappointed many to shift for themselves. Not a few would take away from higher education what is at present one of its chief attractions, namely, as a gateway for merit to the better paid appointments in the public service. Some would be content with insisting on special or additional qualifications as a means of reducing competition and at the same time for ensuring greater efficiency among those employed. Others would narrow the range of selection, without particular reference to efficiency, by means of communal ratios and class preferences. Needless to say, devices which serve but to contract; instead of enlarging, the prospects of employ. ment for large numbers, will only aggravate the real evil</p>
		<p>Ways and means for relieving the tragedy of unwanted and idle talent cannot be indefinitely put off. The task of finding suitable remedies, which will not narrow the benefits of higher education, requires to be taken up seriously and in a broad-minded spirit. The matter is one which concerns alike the Government, the University, and the public. The primary responsibility, naturally, rests with the Government, as the supreme guardian of the interests and welfare of the people, not to speak of its unique position as the largest employer of labour and intelligence. It is up to the University to consider, among other things, how far its courses of instruction can be endowed with a greater measure of relevancy to the after-careers of pupils. The fact that some of the existing courses, as in Medicine and Engineering, do directly lead to professional competency, is sufficient proof that the equipping of students for practical life is not beyond the purview of recognized schemes of study. An imunediately practicable and useful departure would be the institution of new or alternative courses with a definite vocational utility or trend, to which pupils with little or no aptitude for academic subjects could be switched off at the proper stages. This would have the incidental advantage of relieving the occasional overcrowding and congestion in some of the classes, and also of obviating the not uncommon spectacle of melancholy processions of students wandering from class to class and from college to college in the search for admittance. Then there is the very helpful part which can be played by public bodies, industrial organizations, and classes and individuals generally who are possessed of influence and patronage,- if their sympathy and co-operation be enlisted-in providing attractive openings for an increasing number of University men.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, you the new fledged graduates can but make the best of the situation. This is rather better﻿ at the moment than it might have been, because of the great demand for trained personnel for services connected with the War. The choice of a profession is, when all is said, an individual matter, dependent on necessity, opportunity and personal inclination, just as much as in the matter of choosing a partner for life. It scarcely lends itself to practical advice of a general kind. But I will say this, that you should not make a haphazard choice, led by an idle desire to follow a beaten track, or drift from lack of imagination and energy into the first opening that offers ; nor should you be influenced solely by the pecuniary or other superficial attractions. It is at least as important as anything else for your future happiness and success that the profession of your choice is congenial to your interests and your temperament, and that it is one for which you have the requisite aptitude and capabilities. Once you have made your choice, you have of course to stick to it and inake it the serious business of your life. You should gain mastery of its rules and principles, its unwritten standards and conventions, and spare neither time nor patience to acquire skill and readiness in applying your knowledge. I need hardly add that, in striving for success, you will use such means only as are strictly honourable and as your better nature will approve.</p>
		<p>What work you undertake (and this applies equally to work outside your profession) must be done as well as you can; to ensure this, you must refrain from taking on more than you can efficiently deal with. The temptation to overstrain the energies is one to which ambitious young men are prone; but it must be firmly resisted. You cannot afford to neglect the requirements of physical health in the stress of professional labour. Business success and a comfortable bank balance are poor compensations for an enfeebled constitution and a diminished capacity for the rational enjoyment of the good things of life. A too﻿ close and pertinacious attention to the call of business is apt to get a person into a narrow groove. The springs of culture will stagnate and eventually dry up, if you cut yourselves away from the refining influence of art and music, if you neglect those humanizing studies which serve to broaden the mind and help it to remain fresh and alert, and make no serious attempt to keep abreast of the trends of advancing knowledge.</p>
		<p>You must not be like those short-sighted and selfcentred persons who are so engrossed in themselves or in the making of money that they have no time to spare for their duties as citizens and members of society. The education which you have received brings with it fresh opportunities and also added responsibilities. Instead of being the recipients of the influence of others, you will from henceforth stand in positions whence your own influence will largely tell upon others. Your new responsibilities cannot be properly discharged unless you take a keen interest in the events and movements of the day, and keep yourselves conversant with important questions affecting the country and the people. Your minds must be receptive of new facts and new ideas, and able to appreciate other points of view than your own. But do not be carried away by catchwords and party-cries, and do not slavishly echo a more forceful person's voice. No self-respecting person with pretensions to education will blindly accept ready-made opinions, from whatever source, be it a book or newspaper or platform orator. It is best in every way to form your own independent judgment on the data available to you. Only as you can stand firmly on your own feet and see your own way clearly will you be in a position to give a sound lead to others who may look up to you for advice or guidance,</p>
		<p>Leadership is not a matter of possessing a following, however numerous and influential, but implies a certain﻿ capacity for constructive direction. No country can attain to greatness without leaders wise as well as valiant; but no country need despair as long as its seats of learning can produce men and women of vision and sanity of judgment, with the intellect, character and physical vigour which will fit them to guide their fellows aright. Never were the services of such more urgent and pressing than at this supreme moment when India's destiny is in the balance; and the need is not confined to politics, but extends to all other spheres of national life. The hour often finds the man; and it may be that some of you, the products of · this University, are cast for that arduous role.</p>
		<p>At any rate, it can be said of most of you and your generation that, through the corporate life of school and college, the friendly rivalry and the team spirit of games, the intelligent participation in debates and discussions, the activities and amenities made possible by the University Unions, social work among the poor outside the University walls, and things such as these, you have had useful preparation, not only for leadership, but for that which is no less important, the capacity for concerted action. Nothing great or lasting can be accomplished in social life without willing and organized co-operation. Given this and the spirit of mutual accommodation, which is prepared to yield on unessential points of difference in order to secure unanimity on essentials, there is practically no limit to what can be achieved in the way of national unity and well-being.</p>
		<p>Even the communal disagreements which have grown into such regrettable prominence in recent years should be amenable to friendly settlement in an atmosphere of reciprocity and neighbourly understanding and consideration; the more so because they are not to any large extent due to religious causes, but are grounded mainly on divergences of motive and viewpoint affecting social, economic and political interests. A reasonable spirit of﻿ genuine compromise has, at all events, better chances of composing differences of this kind than mutual denunciation, or one-sided appeasernent.</p>
		<p>There are many directions, besides sectional politics, in which the public spirit of educated youth may find ample scope for useful service. To help the illiterate masses to rise above their age-long condition of stagnation is a great mission, increasing in importance with the growth of the national spirit in India. It requires organized effort, not through paid officials alone, but to a large extent by voluntary agency, devoted to the spreading of popular education and enlightenment, the improvement of traditional methods of agriculture and industry, and the raising of the general standards of living. Another fruitful field is the reform of injurious social customs which, having largely outlived their original purpose and utility, now hamper progress or cause needless humiliation or suffering. Life must be made worth living for all; and tbe first step towards tbis is to alter or eliminate, in a spirit of cautious firmness, all such sources of mischief as offend against that supreme ideal. The elevation of the status of womanhood is a third great sphere in which there is need for sympathetic and concerted action. The seclusion of women, with its apotheosis of the purdah, is bound to disappear, as it is indeed already doing. The fact that there are so many of them among the new graduates is itself a significant indication of a better time coming. In that auspicious future women will surely play an increasingly useful part in social and public life. This makes it all the more necessary that their facilities for education should be amplified, and that it should be on lines appropriate and adapted to their place and functions in the home and outside. Women should undoubtedly have a just measure of property rights (-a matter in which the Mysore State was the first to take legislative action-),﻿and likewise an adequate part and voice in pubno affairs.</p>
		<p>There are, of course, various other lines of progress, which will suggest themselves to you. But in the case of all alike, their significance and effect at a time like the present can only be fully realized by viewing them, not independently by themselves, but against the great background of national rehabilitation. For we are living in one of those moinentous periods of revolutionary change which come in the wake of a protracted and devastating war.</p>
		<p>The greatest War of all time is swiftly moving to its climax. Already, while it has lasted, it has inflicted untold misery and suffering on millions, and spread death and destruction on a scale hitherto undreamt of. Its influence on moral standards, whether between nations or among individuals, has not been altogether beneficial. But, as against this, it has served to quicken many virtues usually dormant, such as fortitude, fellow-feeling, intense love of country, heroism, self-sacrifice. It has in many different ways changed the aspect of civilization; and more than this, it has altered the angle from which men are accustomed to view their own interests and those of their fellows.</p>
		<p>War is no blessing even in disguise ; but it has some mitigating features, and so is not an unmixed evil. It can be placed to its credit that it makes possible largescale innovations and advancements wbich, but for it, would never have been attempted. This present confiagration has compressed into the space of a very few years developments--scientific, mechanical, economic, and other-- which might have taken centuries to bring about. Against the dislocation of established conditions of life, the inflation and scarcity, the vexatious restrictions on individual freedom, and the ever-widening control over private action and discretion, may be set the fact that it﻿ has led to a far-reaching process of nationalization of essential material assets and of the enlistment of human intelligence and inventiveness in the common cause. In these and other ways the War has belped to demonstrate the almost unlimited possibilities of organized planning and co-ordinated activity. It is no exaggeration to say that, if all those tremendous efforts, those unequalled resources and talents, that concentration of enthusiasın, self-denial and determination, which have been devoted to the supreme purpose of winning the War, could be diverted, when it is won, to the restoration and reconstruction of national existence on a wide front, mankind would find itself lifted to an almost unimaginable level of well-being and prosperity. The result cannot but be improved, both in permanence and in quality, by the fact that it would be brought about, not by fear and compulsion as in war-time, but mainly by willing co-operation and free initiative functioning within a comprehensive and approved national plan.</p>
		<p>Several countries have already taken up in right earnest the vital and complex question of post-war reconstruction. In India the time cannot be far off when she will be in a position to manage her own affairs, and there will arise a vast number of problems damouring for attention. Those of you who can should begin from even now a close study of these problems and the manner in which they are being tackled elsewhere. No doubt, circumstances. vary from country to country; but it should be possible to learn something from the example and experience of other peoples, and occasionally even to profit from their mistakes. Soviet Russia affords the most striking instance in history of what resolute national planning can do in entirely changing the social and economic character of a vast territory with racial, political and other conditions somewhat resembling those we have here. In not more than twenty years, at a time too﻿ when the imminence of war had not begun to act as a goad, Russia's far-sighted leaders achieved a complete industrial and agricultural revolution, which has reacted powerfully on the cultural and all other aspects of the national life. It has also, beyond a doubt, put Russia in a position to wage a gigantic war, with ever mounting and impressive successes, against a powerful and ruthless enemy. Nazi Germany, it is true, achieved equally spectacular results in an even shorter interval; but she did this through much more questionable totalitarian methods, and then employed the resulting strength and resources for unscrupulous purposes of aggrandizement and oppression. A notable illustration of bold and statesmanlike planning, on a comparatively limited scale confined to social security problems, is the famous Beveridge plan, which is still under discussion in Britain and has not yet been implemented. Here in India various important matters, such as educational reform, agricultural improvement, increased food production, famine prevention, public health, marketing and transport facilities, the extended use of machinery and distribution of power, monetary stabilization, and so on, are being considered by special committees and departments. Notable spade work, some of which has already attracted much interest, has been done in the same field by able and experienced public men and bodies. You will have plenty of material, therefore, in the way of results and recommendations, to study, digest and form your own opinions upon.</p>
		<p>Mean while, if you yourselves are hoping to take some useful and active part in building the India of the future, you will have to make very clear to yourselves what is the sort of future you are looking forward to. Is it not one in which not only will more wealth be created, but that wealth will be more widely and equitably distributed; where effective measures will be put in hand for﻿ eliminating those great enemies of progress-poverty, ignorance, disease, and compulsory idleness; where standards of living and comfort will be generally raised, tbe purchasing power of the masses materially increased, and the duty of finding work for the able and willing accepted as a national obligation ? Would you not claim for all persons no less than for yourselves a due measure of life's opportunities, in the way of ensuring to each individual the full development of his personality, of providing him with such vocational training as may be suited to his capacity and aptitude, and thereafter of putting him in the way to obtain appropriate occupation? Would you tolerate social arrangements which imposed or perpetuated artificial inequalities not related to merit or character, or interfered needlessly with legitimate forms of self-expression ? Would you not require of any future polity that may be evolved that it should be democratic in spirit and substance, tbat it should safeguard the fundamental rights of free citizenship, and that it should give to you and others like you a proper voice in the ordering of matters touching your own interests, local, personal and social? It is questions like these which you must put to yourselves and consider in all sobriety; for upon the answer to them will depend the kind of world you will be helping to build, and the conditions and materials you will contribute to the work of reconstruction.</p>
		<p>It may, possibly, occur to some among you whether, in the circumstances in which our country is placed, it would not be best to follow the method of the wise architect, and build from the bottom upwards, securing the foundations, instead of from roofing to ground level. The work might begin with a real and substantial extension of the democratic principle of self-government to the smallest units of popular life and common interest,-the village, township, factory, or, in general terms, the﻿ compact and convenient neighbourhood. This would leave to the people themselves the management of their own immediate concerns, and at the same time serve as basis for further devolutions of collective responsibility on larger and larger groups. The process would find its natural culmination in the autonomous State, founded on affinities of language, panners and customs, and cemented by the bonds of loyalty and constitutional rule. A broad framework of self-government in ascending stages of expansion will, without doubt, be capable of supporting the vast dome of a great Indian Union, offering ample shelter for all peoples and all varieties of culture, and abundant inducement for that close partnership among free and equal States which is necessary for internal solidarity and external security. The - very substantial advantages evolved during a hundred and fifty years and more of the British connection, in the way of a coherent political structure and a growing identity of national interests throughout the vast geographical unity of India, should not be lightly abandoned without adequate substitutes being provided. On the other hand, the independence which consists in the self-sufficient isolation of a number of rival sovereignties jealous of each other is not perhaps the safest guarantee of national freedom.</p>
		<p>This takes us to a region more or less of uncertainty and speculation; and so I stop, my object being simply to make you think about various vital questions for yourselves. The future may not altogether conform to your expectations. It is nearly always the case that visions are rosier in prospect than in realization, and that achievement falls far short of the ideal. But this does not detract from their value as objective and as inspiration. A clear conception of things not yet in being will itself tend to invest them with substance and shape. Without the uplifting power of our ideals we should be but as creatures crawling on the ground. The greatest men of all nations,﻿the outstanding leaders, the spiritual teachers, the famous heroes, the selfless benefactors, all have been in their own way idealists but with a strong sense of reality ; in other words, they were dynamic personalities.</p>
		<p>Youth is eminently the season of hopes and ideals. It is true enough that disillusionment often follows in their wake,-it may be because the hopes are pitched too high and beyond the measure of one's capacity, it may be because the ideals are insufficiently tempered with the elements of good sense and hard fact. But not on that account should you underrate their importance. Entertain lofty aspirations, cultivate generous ideals, but give to them the sharp edge of discipline and practical knowledge ; faith and confidence will then bring accomplishment within reach.</p>
		<p>The world into which you, my young friends, are about to go forth may be full of difficulties and discouragements; but the resolute mind will find in it sufficient room for personal advancement and distinction, and abundant scope for unselfish service. You may not all of you, or all the time, win worldly success; but you can and should always strive for something much better, the approbation of your own conscience. Use your opportunities, then, well and worthily, and in a manner befitting your new position and standing. Preserve by your attitude and by your conduct in life the best traditions of your University. In its name and on its behalf I bid you farewell, wishing every one of you a pleasant, useful, and honourable future.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS<br />Delivered at the Convocation of the University of<br />Mysore on Thursday, 3rd November 1949 by <br />Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee.</h1>		
		<p><em>Your Highness and Members of the Convocation :</em></p>
		<p>I THANK you for the great honour which you have done me by asking me to address this Convocation. When the offer was communicated to me through the Chief Minister of Mysore, I accepted it readily in spite of my many pre-occupations. Having spent many years of my life in the cause of education, the temptation to take part in an academic function such as this proves somewhat irresistible. Apart from this, the invitation recalled to my mind personal reminiscences which I naturally greatly value. The occasion of the first Convocation of your University held thirty one years ago naturally came back to my mind and I thought I was in duty bound to accept the invitation of His Highness the Chancellor to address the Convocation in the first year of its re-birth as a vital and component part of united India. Your University has played a worthy part in the development of Mysore and you may well feel proud of its achievements. You are specially fortunate in having as your Pro-Chancellor today one of the most eminent sons of India in the field of education, and I have not the least doubt that under his inspiring guidance, this University will have a career of continued progress and prosperity. Mysore is rightly regarded as one of the most progressive﻿ territories of India. You have been fortunate in having as rulers of your State men of enlightenment and sagacity who knew that their own future lay in the sound progress of the people whom they were called upon to serve. Equally fortunate has Mysore been in securing the services of a long line of distinguished administrators and statesmen who worked ungrudgingly for raising the wealth of the State, creating a new status for it and for its people. May I take this opportunity of paying my tribute of affection and respect to one such great son of Mysore who is still with us and whose energy continues unabated even though he will soon be completing four-score and ten years of human life? I naturally refer to Sir M. Visvesvaraya. He has been an inspirer of good and great things not in Mysore alone, but in the whole of India. Mysore today is attracting to its area new industries from different parts of the country, including some important units which are functioning under the direct auspices of the Government of India. I am happy to announce that one important addition to industrial undertakings is soon going to be made, for we have decided to establish in Mysore the new machine tool factory which will be owned and controlled by the Government of India. The University of Mysore will, I am sure, take the fullest advantage of the rapid industrial development of this part of the country, and along with another great institution situated within your territory, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, will be able to contribute their full share in the intellectual development of Free India.</p>
		<p>Our Universities sprang up as affiliating and examining bodies whose main function was to hold and supervise the examinations of students belonging to the affiliated colleges. They had hardly any teaching function, nor did they regard the training of broad-minded and selfreliant citizens as one of their primary responsibilities. Gradually, however, the universities were transformed into teaching institutions and during the last forty years or so we have witnessed renarkable developments in diverse fields of academic activities. Brilliant men of letters and science have come out of our universities who have made their mark in the world, in spheres both academic and public. While these achievements are of no mean order, there are some serious defects from which our system of education has suffered. Collegiate education was imparted on a wide scale but there were not many avenues for the absorption of the Universitytrained youth. Admission to services after all afforded a limited scope, and in the absence of any parallel growth of agriculture and industries many of them were faced with unemployment or only partial employment. The irony of it was that, even when agriculture and industries began to grow, the products of our universities were often found unsuitable for employment. They were principally cast in one mould. Education did not carry out at appropriate levels a combination of general, scientific, artistic and technical training for students of varying abilities and occupational objectives.</p>
		<p>With the attainment of freedom the whole background has changed and the magnitude of the problem increased. University education, already inadequate before the transfer of power, has become more so in the context of freedom. We have now a wider conception of the duties and responsibilities of universities, because we are faced with great problems, social, economic and political. The acquisition of economic independance,﻿ raising the standard of living of the people and the attainment of an effective democracy based on ideals of one common nationhood are some of them. Our universities have to provide leadership in politics and administration, the professions, iudustry and commerce. They have to meet the increasing demand for every type of higher education, literary and scientific, technical and professional. They must help the country in attaining self-sufficiency in food and in relieving it from want, disease and ignorance. There is, in short, no freedom without knowledge.</p>
		<p>The system of our education has also to be related to a new conception of social order. The preamble to our new Constitution has declared that ours will be a sovereign, democratic Republic which secures to all its citizens justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. We have to mould our education according to this ideal. Our administrators in the past succeeded remarkably well in the maintenance of law and order but they often failed in times of crisis and emergency, whether social or economic. We must now have a broader objective for our education. Maintenance of peace and security is of course of fundamental importance and must be provided for. Nevertheless, our youth must have a wider outlook and be imbued with a spirit of social service and corporate life. Our education, in other words, must be such as will be suitable to a democratic constitution. But democracy is not merely a form of Government but a way of life. It cannot function without an understanding and sympathetic electorate. It is from this point of view that universal adult education assumes a great significance. Adult franchise and adult education must go together and since we are going to have the former we must soon provide for the latter. Universities and﻿ their alumni cannot grow in isolation. They form an integral part of a progressive community and must reflect the highest aspirations of the people.</p>
		<p>Apart from these general features of university education, there are many other aspects which will have to be considered in the practical field. One of them is agricultural education. The position of agriculture in our country is well-known. Nearly three quarters of our people are engaged in agricultural pursuits and yet rural India as a whole is sunk in poverty and backwardness. Our national supply of food and raw materials is precariously insufficient. The existing facilities to promote agricultural study are both inadequate and defective. The University Education Commission in its report to Government has, therefore, recommended that agricultural education should be recognised as a major national issue. In a democratic country any sound agri. cultural policy must rest on the understanding and participation of those engaged in agriculture. The study of agriculture in primary, secondary and higher education should be given high priority. More particularly, it should be given a rural setting so that it may include direct participation in an experience with agricultural life and practice. The present agricultural colleges should be strengthened in equipment and in teaching staff and they should endeavour to find some relation to agricultural practice or some related interest such as agricultural credit or co-operatives.</p>
		<p>Education in engineering and technology is equally inadequate. The 'need for technical personnel in our country has been estimated at nearly 27,000 during the next five to ten years. This includes engineers, architects, metallurgists and chemical technologists. The outturn of Indian colleges is about 1,100 every year. The prospective supply thus falls far below the demand. This gap may be filled if the recommendations of the Committee for Higher Technological Institutions are quickly implemented. This Committee recommended that not less than four higher technical institutions-one in the North, one in the East, one in the South and one in the Westshould be set up to satisfy our requirements. The recommendations have been accepted by the All-India Council for Technical Education and plans for the establishment of two institutes, one in the West Bengal and the other in Bombay, are already under preparation.</p>
		<p>Another fruitful sphere in which facilities for training should exist is art and architecture. India has made significant contributions in these fields and her works of art and architecture have drawn admiration from many lands. To maintain our cultural unity and our link with the glorious past, ample facilities for training in these fields should be provided for.</p>
		<p>While these measures will go a long way in creating an adequate technical personnel for our country, opportunities must exist for absorbing them in industries and agriculture. Our experience shows that even when the demand for trained men is considerable, many people who have gained technical proficiency do not always find suitable avenues for the use and utilisation of their talents. It is needless to point out that our industries must furnish a large field for the employment of our young men and I would appeal to our industrialists to employ our trained personnel in suitable spheres. In fact if they do so, they will be only acting in enlightened self-interest.</p>
		<p>Apart from this, there should be provision for vocational guidance to steer our young men along the right channels. We must see to it that there is no overcrowding in any branch of studies while others suffer from a dearth of men. Our demands are varied and extend to large and diverse fields such as engineering, metallurgy, chemical technology, architecture, medicine, agriculture, teaching, and the like. There is no reason why there should be a surfeit of trained men in one or two directions. Vocational guidance should be able not only to bring about a more equable distribution of available resources and talents but also give a correct lead to our alumni in respect of the course of study they should pursue. This should be provided for as early in their career as possible. Our failure to tackle this problem will increase the wastage in human material and money and the resultant loss will be not to individuals alone but to the nation itself.</p>
		<p>Women's education is another important problem. The increase in the number of women students in recent years has been most remarkable and their successes in various competitive fields of academic activity are indeed gratifying General education for intelligent living and for citizenship in large part can be the same for men and women. Women should share with men the life and thought and interests of the times. It does not follow, however, that in all matters men's and women's education should be identical. While no restriction can and should be imposed, yet there are ways in which women's interests in appropriate fields of work diverge from those of men. The part which educated women can play in building up Free India should be capable of clearer definition. The teaching profession, social and welfare﻿ work, nursing and like pursuits are specially suited to them. The demand for these services is likely to increase in the near future and should afford facilities for training to a much larger number of women than at present.</p>
		<p>On the question of post-graduate training, I would like to lay emphasis on one particular point and that is the provision of research. Universities should develop research training in as many branches of knowledge as possible and liberal funds should be provided for this purpose. Apart from researches in the domain of science and technology, complex problems are daily arising for solution in the fields of economics, including public finance, sociology and constitutional law. These issues are often clouded by partisan and political bias. India looks up to her universities to study them dispassionately and critically and offer remedies for their solution, based on knowledge of conditions obtaining in this country and abroad. I lay great stress on the role which universities can thus play in shaping the future destiny of Free India. Co-ordination of research activities among Indian universities can and should be achieved on a voluntary basis. This must not unduly curtail the rights of any institution to tackle any basic problems or pursue any special programme of work which may be of importance to the region it serves. Sometimes the special aptitude of a teacher or scholar determines the selection of subjects for research. Not only should the university assist those who have established their reputation to conduct research but it should be its constant aim to discover new talents among its alumni and encourage them in the pursuit of their activities in every possible way. No money spent on research can ever go to waste. It is bound to come back in the form of higher national wealth and productivity. This of course raises the question of finance and the many problems connected with it. The financial position of our universities is far from satisfactory. In most cases they are working on a deficit budget and their revenue from different sources is hardly sufficient to meet the present needs. Conditions during the war and in the post-war period have brought about abnormal increases in expenditure under heads which could not be anticipated. A remedy for the situation must be found out if university education is to progress on right lines and if the universities in India have to take their full share in the responsible task of building up the structure of Indian education. The State should recognise its responsibility for the financing of higher education. Financial help, however, should in no case lead to any restriction of the independent outlook of the universities. Should there be any need for periodical survey of the progress made by the universities and their financial position, cornmissions or reviewing committees can be appointed for the purpose. But the autonomy of the university must be preserved at all cost and no attempt should be made to treat it as a department of the Secretariat. It is true that education in all its stages is an obligation of the State but State aid should not be confused with State control.</p>
		<p>There is one big responsibility resting on our universities. This is the promotion of cultural unity among our people. Politically and geographically we are more closely knit today than before in spite of partition. Five hundred and odd States, which had hitherto stood aloof from the political current and life of India, have been brought within a unified political structure. This is undoubtedly a great gain, but national unity and﻿  progress require a deeper foundation than mere political and economic arrangements. What holds the society together and gives the individual balance and perspective, is culture. It should be the endeavour of our universities to create that unity in diversity which has been the key-note of India's civilization. Our people in different parts of the country speak their own languages and observe their own habits and customs. In spite of this there is an under-current of unity among them. The university is the forum through which this unity should be further strengthened. There should be regular intercourse between people with diverse habits and languages and with a view to promote this in every university there should be provision for the scientific study of the various languages in the country. The study of Sanskrit, the mother of all languages, should be revived. Special facilities and encouragement should be given to students to study it as part of liberal education. While for linguistic purposes there are to be different scripts for different languages, attempts should be made to evolve a common Dev Nagri script in the cultural field in the long run. There should be frequent interchange of students and teachers between the universities and this should take place both at national and international levels. The primary , necessity, however, is to bring about national consolidation first so that we may be the better able to take part in international affairs.</p>
		<p>The youth of our country a cross-section of whom has assembled here to receive their diplomas, was the spear-head of action in the days of our national struggle. It is my fervent wish that they should continue to be the vanguard in the constructive phase which has begun with the attainment of freedom. There﻿ was a time when any criticism of the Government was regarded as highly patriotic. This was because the Government which ruled the country was an alien one. But the whole background has now changed. We have our own Governments at the Centre and in the provinces. Our primary need is to consolidate our hard-won political freedom and establish the equally necessary political freedom which is far away. The youth of our country must now develop a more positive outlook and help the Government in bringing about • a democratic social order which will promote the welfare of all. I do not of course mean that the Government should be immune from all criticisms but these criticisms must be informed by a higher purpose than mere negation. I cannot help referring here to the unrest which sometimes prevails amongst our students. In part it has followed from world conditions. Chaos is today international and continental. We in India, from immemorial tradition have, however, believed in the practice of “Dharma"-those principles of life and conduct whịch hold together the diverse elements of human society. I would therefore appeal to our students not to be swayed by political cliques and anarchical elements which want to exploit them for their own purpose. I am confident that they believe in Dharma and not in chaos. Now that freedom has been won, university students today have an advantage over their predecessors in the sense that they can devote themselves single-mindedly to their studies and their preparation for the struggles in life that lie ahead of them I feel that the time has now come when the best interests of the country would be served by students taking an intelligent interest in all social and political problems but not indulging in party politics.﻿</p>
		<p>The students who have gone through years of painstaking studies and have assembled here today will now be seeing life and the world. The struggle for existence begins and the world may not always appear to them to be the same as they had conceived in their fancy and dreams. The education, which you have received in colleges and in the University, will have served its purpose if it helps you to face the world and solve life's problems. Your education will never be complete unless it is enriched by your experience with the world. From the University you are now going to the training ground for life and I wish you the best of luck and prosperity in whatever field you may join. Do not be cowed by temporary difficulties, however great. Face them with manly courage; in struggle only, there is the joy of living. May the training you have received endow you with courage, wisdom and faith to fulfil your part worthily in helping not only to reshape the future of Mysore but also to enhance the glory and prestige of our motherland.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS<br />Delivered at the Mysore University Convocation on 8th<br />January 1954, by Radha Kumud Mookerji, M.P.,M.A., PH.D.,D.Litt.</h1>
		<p>I APPRECIATE the honour done to me by the kind invitation of Your Highness to deliver this year's Convocation Address at the Mysore University, and the opportunity it gives me of renewing my contact with Mysore where I had worked as a Government Servant, and as the first Professor of History of this University during the years 1917-1921. I retain to this day vivid memories of the many places of scenic beauty in this charming country, its historical and holy centres, and some of its unique public institutions.</p>
		<p>I also feel that I have a melancholy duty to perform on this occasion, to pay my tribute of respect to the memories of some of my old colleagues at the Maharaja's College, Mysore: the late Dr. C.R. Reddy who was then the Principal of the College, and, later, filled the exalted office of Pro-Chancellor of this University; Prof. N. S. Subba Rao who rose to be its Vice-Chancellor; and Prof. K. T. Shah who achieved eminence as a member of the Constituent Assembly and the Provisional Parliament.﻿</p>
		<p>And I also tender my humble homage to the revered memory of the founder and first Chancellor of this University, His Late Highness Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar Bahadur, to whose munificence the University and, indeed, the whole State of Mysore owe so much.</p>
		<p>I should also pay my humble tribute of respect to the memory of the then Vice-Chancellor Sir Brajendranath Seal who rendered such conspicuous services to the University and to the State by his profound learning, wide administrative experience, and outstanding personality.</p>
		<p>I may at the outset congratulate the University on the remarkable progress achieved by it during the last three decades. This progress may be assessed in terms of the number of students, of Departments, Subjects of Study, and Colleges, and also expenditure. Its strength of 1050 in 1921 has now increased to 4631 in Degree classes, 4334 in the Professional Colleges, and 10229 in the Intermediate Colleges, totalling 19,194, not counting the numbers in the affiliated institutions. There has also been a notable expansion in regard to Subjects of Study and Institutions. New Departments have been started for the study of subjects, such as Home Science, Journalism, Music, Public Administration and Social Administration, together with the new Faculties of Commerce, Education, Law and Indology. There are also established two First Grade Colleges and several Intermediate Colleges at District Headquarters. The University is also strengthened by a chain of Professional Institutions like Medical, Agricultural,﻿Engineering, Commerce, Law, Technological and Teachers' Training Colleges. As regards expenditure, it has steadily gone up from Rs. 9,28,590 in 1921 to Rs. 47,50,000 for this year.</p>
		<p>I think that it will be admitted on all hands that in these times of turmoil, conflict and revolutionary changes, political, social and economic, when mankind lacks that sense of security which alone can set free the creative forces of the human mind, the University has to play an increasingly important part 'in shaping the destinies of the world by educating its governing mind of the future. Its main purpose should be the training of efficient manhood for every department of social and national activity with a view to ihe mobilisation of all the cultural and spiritual resources of the country for the paramount objective of national security and progress. It is the University that by its disciplined and detached thinking is expected to evolve the cosmopolitan mind, the international outlook, and foster a sense of the fundamental unity of mankind as the foundation of Universal Brotherhood and Peace in <em>One World.</em></p>
		<p>In the light of this great mission which the University has to fulfil in the present phase of human history, I should like to adopt as its motto a Vedic passage of supreme significance :</p>
		<p class="text-center">अविद्यया मृत्युं तीर्त्वा विद्ययाऽमृतमश्नुते ।</p>
		<p>“One must first cross the Ocean of the Objective, the Ephemeral and the Mortal <em>(Mrityu)</em> by performance of Duty or Disinterested Service, <em>(Nishkima Karma Avidyā)</em> to achieve purity of heart﻿<em>(Chittasuddhi).</em> Then will dawn upon him the true knowledge (Vidyā) by which he will attain the Immortal or the Divine <em>(Amritam).”</em></p>
		<p>If the supreme mission of Man is to attain immortality and become a <em>Mrityunjaya,</em> the supreme objective of the University should also be to help in Man's self-fulfilment by laying proper stress upon the highest knowledge, and not upon intermediate truths and half-truths, in its intellectual programme</p>
		<p>The University, from its name, is to cultivate a universal outlook, should stand mainly for things that are universal, those elements of knowledge which are of universal value, and not limited by national frontiers, or to any particular age or clime. We may recall the noble exhortation of the great Buddhist teacher, Aryadeva, to the sovereigns of the world that they should follow the Dharma that is without territorial limit, the Code of Laws applicable to all.</p>
		<p>But the University is also a material entity with a local habitation and a name. It may be extraterritorial in thought, but is regional as a reality. Therefore, every University has a local aspect which it has to preserve and promote as one of its duties towards the community to whom it owes its foundation and maintenance. It must help in the utilisation and exploitation of all the resources of its region, material, moral and cultural, by appropriate scientific, technological, cultural and professional Institutions, of which this University has already had a good record. Besides the University's own Institutions, it has the advantage of several All-india﻿ Institutions iworking within its region, the Tata Institute of Science, Raman Academy of Science, Food Technological Research Institute, Dairy Research Institute, Hindusthan Air Craft Factory, Telephone Factory, Machine Tool Factory, and the like.</p>
		<p>I suggest the following motto of the famous French Chemist, Louis Pasteur, for these scientific institutions :</p>
		<p>“Take interest, I implore you, in the sacred dwellings which one designates Laboratories. Demand that they be multiplied and advanced. There it is that Humanity grows greater, stronger better."</p>
		<p>The University of Mysore has also so far done well by its local language and culture the promotion of Kannada learning and literature, and the conservation of its traditions, social, cultural, and economic, in and through a multiplicity of appropriate institutions established at select centres of the State.</p>
		<p>The University of Mysore has also to be the custodian of its regional Karņāțaka Culture as a valuable element of Indian Culture. Mysore must be proud of its glorious past as an offshoot of the Vijayanagara empire which was predominantly a Karnataka empire. Mysore is the heir of its rich traditions, chiefly religious toleration which made it the happy home of divergent faiths which have flourished equally on its congenial soil. Jainism came to Mysore in the 4th Century B.C. with Bhadrabāhu and Chandragupta Maurya associated with Sravana Belgola dominated by the lofty statue of the Jain﻿ Saint Gommateśvara. Buddhism came with Asoka. Both these religions spread in the State from different centres. The older Vedic religion in its different forms flourished equally, Saivism, Vaishnavism, Sakti Worship, and Vedantism. Mysore attracted to it great religious leaders like Sarkara who founded his main Matha at Sringeri; Rāmānuja who settled in Melkote; Basava, the founder of the Lingayat Sect of Vīrašaivas; and Madhva, whose disciples spread his Vedanta doctrine in Kanarese. The liberal religious policy of the State was officially declared in a Kannada inscription which states: "He whom the Saivas worship as Siva, the Vedantins as <em>Brahma</em> the Buddhas as <em>Buddha,</em> the Naiyāyikas as <em>Kartā,</em> the Jains as <em>Arahan,</em> the Mimāṁsakas as <em>Karma;</em> may that God Keśava ever grant your desires". The God Keśava invoked here is God Chenna Keśava of the famous temple at Belur bearing this inscription which presents the appropriate religious policy for Republican India as a secular State treating all religions equally. Mysore is thus remarkably rich in monuments, Jain, Buddhist, and Brahmanical, temples of Siva, Sakti and Vishnu.</p>
		<p>In this connection, I may remind this august audience of a historical fact which points to Mysore as one of the pioneers of modern education in the whole of India. Two years before Lord William Bentinck's Resolution of March 1835 on Macaulay's historical Minute on the introduction of occidental learning in India, His Highness Maharaja Sri Krishnaraja Wadiyar III founded, out of his privy purse, the Raja's Free School which thus occupies a unique place in educational history as the first modern school of Mysore.</p>
		<p>As regards the universal aspect of University studies, it is fully represented in the Mysore University is one of the most progressive Universities. The universal aspect is comprehended by the Groups of Subjects which may be broadly classified into the <em>Humanities</em> and the Sciences. The contents of the subjects embraced by each of these two divisions are well-known and adopted by every modern University. But I may, in this connexion, dwell upon some fundamental points and problems that have arisen in regard to these two domains of knowledge. The first problem is that of the adjustment between the claims of the Humanities and the Sciences (including technology and its offshoots) upon the University's attention and resources. A grave danger that now faces Universities is that both the State and individuals are for the time being more obsessed by the idea of encouraging and endowing science at the Universities at the expense of the Humanities for which there is not much concern. It is, however, forgotten that by abridging or belittling the Humanities, “both Universities and both sets of studies would suffer from the resulting intellectual and moral impoverishment. The great value of the Universities is the juxtaposition, intellectually and socially, of the best minds in diverse subjects and the constant interaction of the Humanities and Sciences on one another. This value is all the greater in an age﻿ which is given to materialism with a tendency to look too much for immediate and tangible return” (Report of Asquith Royal Commission on Cambridge and Oxford, p. 45). Among the best products of the system of combining the study of Science with Humanities may be mentioned the two great outstanding English Statesmen, Robert Peel and William Gladstone. They both took first in Mathematics as well as Classics,</p>
		<p>The other fundamental problem concerns the study of science itself at the Universities. First of all, there is a conflict between the claims and values of Pure Science as against Applied Science. This problem has been brought to the fore by the present age of World Wars in which Science and Technology play such a decisive part. Science is now viewed in a new relation to national development. But even in the sphere of the application of Science to practical problems, it must be always borne in mind that in order to get the greatest scientific results, even of a practical character, “investigations carried on with merely technical objects and in a purely utilitarian and commercial spirit, will not achieve the highest results ” (16.). We should never forget the primary truth and principle of knowledge that “the detached and disinterested pursuit of scientific investigation, a whole-hearted devotion to Pure Science, affords the surest means by which the nation can ultimately command the resources of Nature". (16.). It is, therefore, very necessary in the interest of the advancement of knowledge that Pure Science should not suffer by neglect in the interest of Applied Science.﻿</p>
		<p>It is now well known how scme of the advanced Universities of the West in Germany, U.K. and U.S.A. were able to make important contributions in the prosecution of the war by their learned and scientific Services and also by the spirit of selfsacrifice engendered in the cultural atmosphere of the Universities. No nation concerned in the last two World Wars can ever forget the immense debt it owes to University men whose training in languages, in Pure and Applied Science, or Economics, specially fitted them to grapple with new and totally unexpected problems which arose in the course of the War and called for their rapid solution. “The value of University men in war was to be found not only in the specialised knowledge but in the adaptability, inventiveness and suppleness of the well-trained brain. Alike in the field, at home and abroad, these qualities were the special gifts of the Universities, old and new, to the war-strength of the nation, as they are to its peace-strength day by day” (16.).</p>
		<p>The conditions in which the last two World Wars were fought and the radically changed conditions foreshadowed in the war to come (if it is to come) in the new Atomic Age, force upon Universities the necessity for a considerable overhaul in the programme of their scientific and technological studies. The Wars of the age will require a scientific solution of many new problems which were not known before. These are connected with the following topics :-(1) ballistics ; (2) meteorology; (3) the structure of the atmosphere; (4) aerial fight; (5) compasses for aeroplanes,﻿ aerial photography, and bombing sights; (6) soundranging, wireless, and methods for detecting submarines; (7) the development of offensive and defensive gas-warfare, and the treatment of gassed patients ;(8) manufacture of explosives, and of drugs ; (9) inoculation and preventive medicines ; (10) the value of foodstuffs, the production of crops and meat for feeding the nation; and (11) engineering problems (Asquith Commission, p. 47).</p>
		<p>There is now developed a regular Defence Science to meet the surprises which modern wars always spring. For instance, World War II was decided by weapons unknown at its outbreak. These new weapons are the product of science. Again, deaths caused by epidemics and septic wounds were less than actual deaths in battle. This is due to discovery of penicillin. In previous wars, the result was the reverse.</p>
		<p>World War II has brought to the fore the following new subjects of science among others :-</p>
		<p class="verse">1. Short-wave study<br /> 2. Non-linear equations<br /> 3. Servo-mechanisms<br /> 4. Thermodynamics for explosives <br />5. Studies in armaments and basic principles of weapons.<br /> 6. Nuclear Physics.</p>
		<p>Defence Science, as a whole, aims at enabling the armed forces to make the best operational use of their existing weapons and equipment, and at the discovery.by continuous researches of new weapons so as to gain a lead over the enemy. What matters﻿ most in weapons is their operational effectiveness. Defence rests upon weapon efficiency and also weapon economics. Defence Science must also achieve increase in the range of action of existing weapons, their improvement in striking power, in speed and mobility, and the accuracy with which they can invade a target. Again, Military Engineering is called for to build roads, canals, and bridges at emergencies. Sometimes, however, theoretical science and its laboratory may be directly used as almost a front line of offence and defence, as in the case of Radar.</p>
		<p>Lastly, even Geology and Mineralogy are to be studied from a new angle of vision. Dr. D. N. Wadia has shown that out of 23 minerals and metals considered vital in war, India has only 13. India will be hard hit in war for lack of these strategic minerals, especially petroleum and petroleum products. The remedy is production of substitutes for civilian use and stock-piling of the other materials, so that the resulting surpluses may cover the deficit in regard to the aforesaid essential minerals and raw materials in short supply. (Dr. D. N. Wadia and D. S. Kothari in <em>Defence Science Journal</em> for 1952).</p>
		<p>In suggesting the study of these New Sciences in response to the requirements of the age and postwar developments, my intention has been only to see that the Universities do not become out of date in the fields of Science and Technology by continuing the study of subjects that have been rendered obsolete by the emergence of new subjects to replace them, or are outmoded by new processes. Such a﻿ re-orientation of scientific study may involve additional expenditure, some of which may come out of the Defence Budget of the Central Government under a system of co-ordination and co-operation in work in a common field between the Defence Department and the Universities. I also take it that preparation and measures for Defence and Security do not at all commit the country to any aggressive military aims inconsistent with the principles of peace for which it stands in this age of strife and conflict.</p>
		<p>I shall now pass from these practical problems and new studies called for in the present conditions of world-politics to the existing direct problems of the Universities. We are living in an age of unitary and residential Universities with all facilities of learning in comparative ease and freedom from worry. We have left far behind the trying conditions under which the poor clerks' of mediaeval Universities in Europe, for example, faced the direst poverty in the pursuit of knowledge, conditions which are aptly described by the poet:</p>
		<p class="verse">"Wher learning like a stranger came from far," and <br />"Lovers of truth, by penury constrained ” <br />“Led in abstemiousness a studious life;<br />“When in forlorn and naked chambers cooped <br />And crowded, over the ponderous books they hung".</p> 
		<p>But poverty in India is still to-day the greatest handicap to a student in his study. Many thoughtful leaders view with misgivings the spectacle of palatial hostels for the residence of students at Universities, who will find it difficult after study to adjust themselves﻿ to the huts awaiting them at home. In ancient times India thought out her best and highest in her hermitages and sylvan retreats, Parņaşālās figuring as the abodes of Rishis in even early Indian sculptures, as in those of Bharhut. Urban Universities create a gulf between the academy and the life of the masses from whom the students are mostly recruited, It is time that we make a start in giving to the Universities some rural centres where they will be able to achieve the greatest good of the greatest number by contact with the masses. The spread of education is as necessary as its standard. Height is not more important than width. We must not forget that the nation in India still lives in the village and the cottage. India still means lacs of villages as against a few towns. Indian civilisation has been built up through the ages not as an urban but as a rural civilisation. As the poet Rabindranath Tagore points out in his inimitable words:</p>
		<p>“A most wonderful thing we notice in India is that here the forest, not the town, is the fountain head of all its civilisation. Wherever in India its earliest and most wonderful manifestations are noticed, we find that men have not come into such close contact as to be rolled or fused into a compact mass. There, trees and plants, rivers and lakes, had ample opportunity to live in close relationship with men. In these forests, though there was buman society, there was enough of open space, of aloofness; there was no jostling. Still this aloofness did not produce inertia in the Indian mind; rather it rendered it all the brighter. It is the forest that﻿  has nurtured the two great ancient ages of India, the Vedic and the Buddhist. As did the Vedic Rishis, Lord Buddha also showered his teachings in the many woods of India. The current of civilisation that flowed from its forests inundated the whole of India."</p>
		<p>It may be noted that these rural schools of ancient India stand amply justified by the volume, variety and quality of their creative output as represented in the vast body of Sanskrit literature and its offshoots, Pali and Prakrit. Some of it like the Upanishads register the high watermark of human wisdom.</p>
		<p>The tradition of India has been to believe in the small industry rather than mass-production. She believes in handicrafts producing works of art as against standardised products of factories, of large plant and machinery. Mechanised education is against her genius. She stands for individual, personal, treatment in education. But that has not prevented India from building up a centralised educational institution like the University or <em>Mahāvihāra</em> of Nalanda where, according to the testimony of the Chinese student of Nalanda, the famous scholar Yuan-Chwang, who lived there for five years (from A.D. 635 to 640), there were in residence 8500 scholars who were taught by 1,510 teachers, delivering between them daily 100 lectures on 100 different subjects, to as many seminars of advanced students hailing from such remote foreign countries as Mongolia, Korea, Tukhara, and Java, one of whose kings endowed a college at Nalanda﻿ for Javanese students. The proportion of the number of teachers to taught.at Nalanda was I : 5.</p>
		<p>That advanced educational thought in the West is seeking reform in this direction is illustrated by a recent donation of the American philanthropist, Mr. Harkness, added to the millions of dollars with which he has endowed his old school, the Phillips Academy at Exeter, in the State of New Hampshire. The donation has been made on the condition that there should be on the staff of the school at least one teacher for every ten boys. A leading Journal commenting on this singular gift states, “Mr. Harkness, like many thoughtful Americans, is apprehensive that in the large number flooding into the higher educational institutions of the U.S.A., there was a danger of mass production, and a loss of all that was of the highest value in education. As Wordsworth said: Numbers swamp humanity” <em>(Roman Ancient Indian Education </em>(London), p. xxxvii).</p>
		<p>The record of one of the greatest educational Institutions of the world, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, shows that the Institute employs 1,171 Professors who teach 4,874 students more than 900 subjects, showing the ratio of the number of teachers to taught as I:5, while each subject is taught by a specialist Professor. Thus the number of subjects to be taught is a factor in fixing the number of teachers to secure efficiency of teaching.</p>
		<p>The educational thought of U. K. also lays great stress upon the principle of individual treatment in education. This principle has been embodied at the﻿ two prominent Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in what is called the College and Tutorial system. Indeed, the problem of the University there is the adjustment of balance between University and College in higher education. There is a good deal to be said for the college system which stimulates much individual activity and initiative among graduates and under-graduates and their contributions which enrich the life and learning of the University itself, while it makes academic life more pleasant and interesting to the youth. Indeed, much of the attractions and reputation of Oxford and Cambridge is due to their colleges : Balliol, All Souls, or Christ Church at Oxford ; Trinity or St. John's at Cambridge <em>(Report of Asquith Royal Commission on Oxford and Cambridge,</em> pp 14-16).</p>
		<p>I should, therefore, like the Mysore University authorities to consider in what further ways they can improve and strengthen their colleges situated at both Mysore and Bangalore not merely as units of residence but also as nurseries of discipline and centres of life and learning.</p>
		<p>I should like now to say a word about the earlier stages of education leading up to higher education at the University. For all stages of education are linked together in a common system. It is high time that the earlier stages of education, primary and secondary, and their systems be reformed in the light of Mahatma Gandhi's Scheme of Basic Education. It may be explained briefly in his own words:</p>
		<p>“I hold that true education of the intellect can only come through a proper exercise and training of﻿ the bodily organs-hands, feet, eyes, ears, nose, etc. In other words, an intelligent use of the bodily organs in a child provides the best and the quickest way of developing his intellect.</p>
		<p>The eyes, the ears, and the tongue come before the hand. Reading comes before writing, and drawing before tracing the letters of the alphabet. If this natural method is followed, the understanding of the children will have much better opportunity of development than when it is under check by beginning the children's training with the alphabet.</p>
		<p>“Whatever may be true of other countries, in India, at any rate, where more than 80% of the population is agricultural and another 10% industrial, it is a crime to make education merely literary and to unfit boys and girls for manual work in after-life.</p>
		<p>“The emphasis laid on the principle of spending every minute of one's life usefully is the best education for citizenship and incidentally makes Basic Education self-sufficient. Intelligent labour is for the time being the only primary and adult education in this land of starving millions.</p>
		<p>“The introduction of manual training will serve a double purpose in a poor country like ours. It will pay for the education of our children and teach them an occupation on which they can fall back in afterlife, if they choose, for earning a living. Such a system must make our children self-reliant. Nothing will demoralise the nation so much as that we should learn to despise labour.</p>
		<p>“The greatest drawback of the present system of education is that it does not bear the stamp of﻿ reality, that the children do not react to the varying wants of the country. True education must correspond to the surrounding circumstances or it is not a healthy growth.”</p>
		<p>Gandhiji held that it was not right to teach Crafts merely as a relaxation or an educational hobby but that we should try from the beginning that the children are brought up as good craftsmen. His scheme has a place for different kinds of crafts, which may include not merely and exclusively Spinning and Weaving but also Gardening and Agriculture, Card Board Work, Wood Work, Leather Work, Metal Work, etc. A successful Basic Training School in the Jodhpur State found the following crafts very popular with its pupils: making of Nara, Niwar, Galicha, Asan, Buttons, Paper-flowers and wreaths, Clay-modelling, articles of Paper Pulp, and also Carpentry, Sewing and Embroidery, Tailoring, Gardening and Agriculture, Spinning and Weaving, Jersey-making, etc. The higher schools in this system may introduce such subjects of study as Agriculture, Horticulture, Sericulture, Bee-keeping, Dairy-farming, Poultry-farming, Fisheries, Textiles, etc., together with related parts of Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, Mineralogy, Rural Economics, etc.</p>
		<p>On this system of co-education of Body, Mind, and Spirit through a Craft, Mr. M. L. Jacks, Director of the Department of Education at Oxford, observes :</p>
		<p>“In this visualization and appreciation of an end which is both useful and beautiful, in﻿ the thinking out of the proper means of its accomplishment, in the accuracy of measurement, the manual skill and the manipulation of a tool which is required, in the demands upon the senses of sight and of touch, in the economical and controlled use of physical strength, and in the obvious determination of the will to exclude all distractions and concentrate the whole self upon the job-in all this, intellectual, moral and physical powers are brought into play and operate as one, and the finished article, is self-suppressive and creative act of the whole body."</p>
		<p>It may be noted that this principle of relating education to craft was a recognised principle of Indian education through the ages. The Upanishads are full of it. It governed the life of the Antevāsí (resident pupil) <em>Brahmachārī</em> whose daily duty was to beg for the school, tend the house of his teacher, "guarding him, his home-stead (the domestic school), and his cattle <em>Sarapatha Brāhmana</em> (II, 6, 2, 15)], and tending his cattle." The <em>Chhündogya Upanishad</em> (IV, 4, 5) tells of <em>Satyakāma</em> tending his teacher's cattle till “400 cows became 1,000.” At the Conference of Philosophers convened by King Janaka of Videha (the earliest learned Conference of the world) the royal prize for philosophical primacy was awarded to Sage Yājñavalkya, consisting of (1) 1,000 cows and (2) Five gold-pieces tied to the horns of each so as to make a total of 10,000 gold pieces﻿ exceeding the value of the Nobel Prize. Yajñavalkya coolly asked his pupils to drive home that large herd of cattle because there was accommodation for them in his hermitage which was like a Forest University. Education at these hermitages or Akramas was related to Craft, the national key-industries of Agriculture and Dairy-iarming upon which depended their maintenance and supply of the most nutritive food. Educational benefactions of early days were not paid in cash, but in kind, by grant of land which had to be utilised by profitable farming. Thus every school had to provide for the training of its students in agriculture, rearing of cattle, and dairy-farming.</p>
		<p>Free India as a Republic has thrown upon her educational system great responsibilities for providing that training in citizenship which is the foundation of democracy. The primary requisite of such citizenship in a democracy is a living consciousness of the fundamental unity of the country as a whole, of Bhärata which extends from Kashmir to the Cape. In ancient times, the Fathers of our Civilisation composed verses presenting the conception of the mother country as the supreme object of national worship. There are several prayers in our sacred literature for the worship of the Deity, Dešamātřikā, whose <em>Viratdeha</em> is to be contemplated in meditation. I shall present before you only three such prayers by which the mass-mind of India may be educated in patriotism as the foundation of democratic citizenship. The first of these prayers runs thus :﻿</p>
		<p class="verse">गङ्गे च यमुने चैव<br />गोदावरि सरस्वति । नर्मदे सिंधु कावेरि<br />जलेऽस्मिन् सन्निधिं कुरु ॥</p>
		<p>This prayer enables the worshipper to call up before his mind's eye the visible image of India as the land of the seven sacred rivers pouring forth their bounty in streams of plenty as makers of India's material prosperity. As Egypt is the Gift of the Nile, so is Northern India the Gift of the Ganges and the Sindhu, and the South the Gift of the Godavari, the Tungabhadrā and the Kāveri. A common prayer is uttered at common festivals by the North Indian and the South Indian who feel bound together in ties of a common culture and religion as brethren of the same faith. The devotee prays for the commingling of the sacred waters of these seven rivers in the palm of his hand to impart to him their collective purity, as he takes this preliminary purificatory bath in the river of his own region.</p>
		<p>The second of these national prayers envisages, the mother country as the land of the seven sacred cities which impart to the pilgrim incentive to spiritual life and longing for salvation.</p>
		<p>अयोध्या मथुरा माया <br />काशी कञ्चि अवन्तिका ।<br /> पुरी द्वारावती चैव ।<br /> सप्तैता मोक्षदायिकाः ॥</p> 
		<p>There is a particular significance attaching to each of these seven cities as a powerful spiritual﻿ influence. Ayodhyā is the city of Rāma, the God of millions of Indians whose sacred name Mahatma Gandhi bore on his dying lips! But Sri Rāma is equally one of the Makers of the Nation's history. Māthurā is the sacred city of Lord Kțishņa. Mayā or Mayapuri (Hardwar) is the city of Gangā who first descended here on earth from the Himalayan snows. Kāśi is the city of Śiva, but lest the mind of the devotee tarries too long in the North, he is at once reminded of the pilgrimage he must undertake to Kāñchi (Conjeeveram) in the far South, the joint city of both Siva and Vishnu. The mind of the devotee must next turn towards Central India dominated by the holy city of Avantikā (Ujjain), the city of Mahākāla. Then the circuit of his mental pilgrimage ends with a visit to the western-most point of India, the holy city of Dwarka, associated with Krishna-Vasudeva. At Dwarka is also located one of the four Mutts established by Sri Sankaracharya at the four extreme points of India, by visiting which the pilgrim will have to traverse the whole of India and develop a living sense of its integral unity. These Mutts are : (1) Sringeri in South in Mysore; (2) Govardhana in the East at Puri; (3) Sarada in the West at Dwārakā; and (4) Joshi (or Jyotir) in the North near Badrinath.</p>
		<p>The third prayer presents India as the land of seven mountain systems forming so to speak the physical framework, the very ribs and backbone of the Virātdeha of Mother India. These seven mountain systems are thus described :</p>
		<p class="verse">महेन्द्रो मलयः सह्यः <br />  शुक्तिमान् ऋक्षपर्वतः ।<br /> विंध्यश्च पारियात्रश्च <br />सप्तैते कुलपर्वताः ॥</p>
		<p>This conception of the unity of India as an integral whole, as presented in our religious texts, has been popularised by the Poet Tagore in his inimitable words describing how the sacred feet of Bhārata Mātā are laved by the waters of the deep blue ocean, the Himalayas form Her forehead, their eternal snows Her crown, and out of Her breasts flow streams of ambrosia, the Jahnavi and Yamuna.</p>
		<p class="verse">नील सिन्धु जल <br />धौत चरण-तल ।<br /> अम्बर चुम्बित भाल हिमाचल <br />शुभ्र तुषार किरीटिनी ॥ <br />जाह्नवी जमुना विगलित करुणा ।<br />पुण्य पीयूष स्तन्यवाहिनी ॥ </p>
		<p>The citizens of Free India must keep alive this living conception of the mother country as an integral unity and must see to it that it is not affected by the prevailing trend of political thought towards splitting up India into smaller linguistic States. There is a great danger of the spirit of linguism subduing the spirit of nationalism and militating against the cultivation of an all-India outlook. We must all lay to heart the far-sighted utterance of our beloved leader, the Prime Minister of India, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Andhra State :﻿</p>
		<p>“I am no lover of provincialism or anything that comes in the way of the building up of the conception and the fact of a united India. That does not mean a dead uniformity or too much centralisation. I believe in local autonomy and as large a measure of decentralisation as possible. But we have also to remember that there is no progress to-day without that essential unity and a considerable measure of centralisation. Not only do we weaken politically if we think too much of the parts and less of the whole, but it becomes difficult to plan for economic progress. One of the primary tasks for us to-day is the real emotional integration of India. I hope that the formation of new States and the reorganisation of the present structure of India will not weaken in any way this process of integration of hearts and minds”.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, it is my primary and a pleasant duty to offer, on behalf of the University and my humble self, our whole-hearted congratulations to the graduates of the year, and those who have won special distinctions and the coveted Degrees of Doctorate in different subjects, on the success of their academic career, which to some will mean its end, and entry into the wider life of the world. It is customary on such an occasion for one who addresses the Convocation to address a few words of advice and exbortation to the youths who are now to emerge as citizens on whom will devolve the responsibility of serving their mother-land, the Republic of India, which now stands free of the shackles of the slavery of centuries﻿ as a fully sovereign State and member of the U.N.O. It is for the citizens of India to win for her by this national effort her rightful place in the Comity of Nations. For this purpose, the vast manpower of this great country must be fully mobilised. The days of individual greatness are gone for ever. India must now achieve her collective greatness, a higher level of national efficiency. Towering personalities and solitary eminences will be of no avail, unless they help to raise the average level of the country by constant mass-contact. India boasts of the highest peak of the world, but Mount Everest co-exists with a continental expanse of low-lying plains which very much reduce the average height of the country. There cannot be any hopeful future for a country which has a literacy of only about 15%, and expectation of life at 27 years against about 66 for men and 71 for women in U.K., and almost the same in U.S.A. I feel, therefore, constrained to remind you, our young hopefuls, of the problems that should receive your prior attention. The problem of the country is its growing poverty, its inadequate revenue and resources, which are ultimately due to the low level, the paucity, of its production in both field and factory. Our total federal revenue amounts to about Rs. 425 crores per annum as against about Rs. 500 crores per month in U.K. and about 100 crores per day in U.S.A. Out of India's teeming millions of about 36 crores of people, the number of those assessed to income-tax are about 9 lakhs, while those paying super-tax on﻿ incomes above Rs. 40,000 per annum number only about 14,000. India has practically become now a classless societywhere there is hardly recognisable the distinction between the Haves and Have-nots, as the whole people are reduced to equality in poverty. It is, therefore, the first duty of every citizen of India to add to the wealth of the country by increased production, even if it means his earning wealth for himself. Henry Ford used to say that he counted himself as a great benefactor of the race, because he helped it with something for which it pays for its utility. The growing unemployment in the country which stares us all in the face as the greatest menace confronting us can only be solved by increase of production in all fields of economic activity, in both Agriculture and Industry.</p>
		<p>The second of our national problems is a social problem, the problem of untouchability by which India practically loses about a fifth of its total man power. Our religion has unfortunately given rise in the course of its evolution to curious misconceptions about its true content. It has nothing to do with social customs, the artificial differences of caste and creed, which have no concern with true religion and spirituality. We must recall and lay to heart the fundamental religious position which is thus declared in almost strident tones in the authoritative text known as Narada <em>Pancharātra :</em></p>
		<p>श्वपचोऽपि महीपाल<br />विष्णोर्भक्तो द्विजाधिकः ।<br /> विष्णुभक्तिविहीनश्च <br />यतिर्न श्वपचाधिकः ॥﻿</p>
		<p>“O King, even the Chaņdala who is a devotee of Vishịu is higher than the Dvija (twice-born) and the Yati, who is devoid of devotion to Vishņu, is lower than the Chandāla."</p>
		<p>And again, the same point of view is urged by <em>Haribhaktivilāsa</em> which promulgates a charter of equality for all mankind in the following words :-</p>
		<p class="verse">शूद्रं वा भगवद्भक्तं <br /> निषादं श्वपचं तथा ।<br /> वीक्षते जातिसंज्ञातः <br /> स याति नरकं ध्रुवम् ॥</p>
		<p>“He who keeps in view the lowness of caste in a devotee of the Lord, be the latter a Śūdra, a Nishāda, or a Svapacha, verily he goes to hell”.</p>
		<p>True Hinduism holds up the worship of the deity named Nara-Nārāyaṇa to indicate that the service of Man is the true worship of God, just as the Lord Himself, according to Rāmānuja, renders neverceasing service to his own creatures. It is in this true spirit of religion recognising the fundamental unity of all, irrespective of caste or creed, that we can make our country strong by mobilising its vast man-power latent in its dumb millions.</p>
		<p>In one sense, we are gathered here at this Convocation in a Festival of Youth where Age must also drink in the spirit of Youth. I see before me deployed the youthful mind at the end of a golden quinquennium of glowing hopes and generous enthusiasms. Youth must speak to Youth, like Deep calling unto Deep! Youth must be its own Guide for the future which belongs to Youth, in the﻿ light of its own lamps. Be ye lamps unto yourselves', as the Buddha enjoins, the Lamps which are your own</p>
		<p>The first of your Lamps is the Lamp of subjectivity, freedom from the tyranny, the iron grip, of the hard facts and realities of life. Youth dares to be free. The iron has not yet entered into its soul.</p>
		<p>The second Lamp of Youth is its romance, its exalted sensibility, its bursting freshness and variety. The flame of life burns intense, white and pure, on the altar of youth.</p>
		<p>Its third Lamp is its creativeness, its power of conjuring up a world of its own. Youth's alchemy transmutes the basest metal into its own gold.</p>
		<p>Its fourth Pradipa is its invincible optimism, its perennial spring of joy and song, of hope and adventure. Youth, like a thing of beauty, is a joy for ever. Youth has climbed Everest, has traversed Darkest Africa and reached the Poles, dived into the bottomless sea, and has glimpsed the secrets of the moon and the stars.</p>
		<p>And the fifth Lamp of Pañchapradipa Youth is its sense of immortality, of an inextinguishable, irrepressible life. A thing of Palpitating life, what should it know of death?</p>
		<p>May I also end this exhortation to my youthful audience by reminding them of the following meaningful lines of Shelley, the Poet of Youth?</p>
		<p class="verse">" I slept and dreamt that Life is beauty;<br />I woke and saw that Life is duty.”﻿</p>
		<p>Youth lays the foundation of its future in its Brahmacharya based on the Triple Vow of Chastity, Poverty, and Labour : Vow of <em>Purity</em> in body, mind, and speech , Vow of <em>Poverty</em> in abstention from luxuries; and Vow of <em>Labour</em> in menial service to the <em>Guru-Kula</em> and the Student-Brotherhood, taking charge of its house-hold economy, and even begging for its maintenance.</p>
		<p>Every educated Indian must next be the torchbearer of India's Learning and Culture as so aptly symbolised in our National Flag on which the figure of the wheel is the <em>Dharma Chukri,</em> the kingdom of Righteousness, <em>Rūmarujya,</em> as Gandhiji would say, the Rule of Right which was inaugurated by the great Buddha by his first discourse delivered at Sarnath, known as Dharma-Chakra-PravartanaSatra. The <em>Dharma-Chakra</em> is a secular State in the sense that it does not stand for any particular <em>Dharma</em> or religion of its own but for the Dharma that is universal, the principles of Morality which are acceptable and applicable to entire mankind. The <em>Dharma-Chakra</em> thus points to the moral foundations of the so-called secular State.</p>
		<p>Let me now conclude with the pregnant words addressed by the teacher to his parting pupils, as stated in the <em>Taittiriya Upanishad:</em></p>
		<p>Practise ye Truth, Duty, Study and Teaching ! Don't giv: in to lethargy, but exert ye for your own welfare and prosperity! Revere ye as thy God thy Father and Mother, "Preceptor, and also thy Guest as a symbol of humanity : Practise ye charity in a spirit of esteem. Give according to your means in all﻿ humility, and in a spirit of friendship: And offer ye to thy Alma Mater suitable gifts in return for what you owe Her:</p>
		<p>सत्यं वद । धर्मं चर। स्वाध्यायान्न प्रमदितव्यम् । प्रवचनान्न प्रमदितव्यम् । आचार्याय प्रियं धनमाहृत्य . . . .</p>
		<p> सत्यान्न प्रमदितव्यम् । स्वाध्याय-प्रवचनाभ्यां न प्रमदितव्यम् । कुशलाद्भूत्यै न प्रमदितव्यम् । मातृदेवो भव । पितृदेवो भव । आचार्यदेवो भव । अतिथिदेवो भव। श्रद्धया देयम् । श्रिया देयम् । ह्रिया देयम् । भिया देयम् । संविदा देयम् ।</p>
		<p>Lay to heart also the Message of Lord Buddha wishing godspeed to his disciples : Go ye forth, ye monks, on your daily rounds, ministering to the welfare of the people, promoting their good and Happiness dedicating yourselves to the service of God and Man.</p>
		<p>चरथ भिक्खवे चारिकम् ।<br /> बहुजनहिताय बहुजन सुखाय <br />अत्थाय हिताय सुखाय <br />देवमनुस्सानम् ।(विनय पिटक–महावग्ग) </p>
		<p>Let our young hopefuls be inspired by the message of that master-mind, Max Muller, on the abiding value of India's Culture :-</p>
		<p>“If I were to look over the whole world to find out the country most richly endowed with all the wealth, power and beauty that Nature can bestow in some parts a very paradise on earth---I should point to India. If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most﻿ deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them, which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant--I should point to India. And if I were to ask myself from what literature we, here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact more truly human, a life, not for this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life again I should point to India.”</p>
		<p>Let us recapture this potent heritage of Indian Thought and Life by which we may overcome the menace of this Atomic Age. Scientists have discovered means by which life itself may be wiped off the surface of this planet. They have for the time being released the tremendous destructive power inherent in Matter, which can only be controlled now by the power of the Spirit for which India has stood through the ages. The Spirit of Man is his only hope in this Cosmic Dance of Death, It alone stands between us and a lifeless globe, and will yet enable Man to master Matter and solve this central, universal problem of saving the race from extinction.</p>
		<p>This dangerous international situation has been graphically described by President Eisenhower as presenting two Atomic Colossi who are doomed﻿ malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a trembling world." Will mankind be condemned to begin all over again the age-old struggle upward from savagery toward decency, right and justice?</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Summary of the Address delivered in Kannada at the<br />Mysore University Convocation on 10th December<br />1956 by Shri R. R. Diwakar, Governor of Bihar.</h1>	
		<p>YOUR HIGHNESS, MR. VICE-CHANCELLOR, MEMBERS<br />OF THE SENATE, AND MY DEAR GRADUATES,</p>
		<p>I AM grateful to the authorities of this famed 1 University for having done me the honour of inviting me to deliver the Convocation Address of this year. Well-known scholars and savants. have preceded me year after year in delivering Convocation Addresses to the new graduates. In that galaxy I could have no place except by the great goodwill you have shown towards me. I do not possess any of their qualifications to perform this august function. But I am sure that you will credit me with a sincerity which inspires me to say a few words on this occasion.</p>
		<p>This is an occasion of varied significance to many people. Though this is a recurring routine ritual in the life of a University, it gives us an opportunity to take stock of what has been accomplished so far. The assessment of the educational progress we aave made, the statistics of passes and failures, the relief felt by parents and guardians that their wards have crossed one main hurdle of life, the anticipation that the youth turned out of the University will have acquired the strength and discipline necessary to face the battle of life, the eager expectation that the﻿ swelling of the number of graduates will redound to the credit of the society of which they are a partthese and a few more are the assessments and anticipations with which the minds of the people are naturally occupied on an occasion like this.</p>
		<p>The object of such a special function as the convocation is similar to our celebrating on a special day the birthdays of our great prophets. On that occasion we seek to focus the thoughts of people on the messages that each of them conveyed to mankind. The object of a convocation is just to impress the alumni of a University with the importance of the task that awaits them and with the way in which they have to conduct themselves in life as befits educated men. The convocation is a ritual and a sacrament, a <em>samskara</em> to use a Sanskrit expression. It serves a purpose similar to that of a sacrament, namely, to leave a permanent impress on an impressionable mind which inay stand it in good stead as time rolls on. The human mind grows on what it feeds on. Human culture is the result of these <em>samskaras</em> and the cumulative impressions they produce by which we are inured into a pattern of culture. Every man is born as a young animal. He becomes human and civilized by the transmission and diffusion of culture. We are what our culture has made us. The convocation is a sacrament in the progress of our life. And like the sacraments of yore this also has an appositeness and importance which should not be lost sight of.</p>
		<p>The name convocation' is outlandish and is a gift to us by the English people who ruled over us.﻿But the institution is as old as India's ancient civilization. The Taittiriva Upanishad gives a beautiful picture of a convocation held three thousand years ago--an impressive ceremony leaving a lasting impression on the mind of youth embarking on the householder's life. There is no new or old then about this matter. The convocation is a stage in life's journey and is a state of being at which one has arrived after trouble and travail. This is a gala day for those candidates who have been lucky enough to participate directly in this ritual. I will not be far wrong if I say that they are the real actors of the drama that is being enacted here. I heartily congratulate them on this joyous occasion and wish them a happy future. The convocation marks a moment of crisis when one steps out into the wider world from the threshold of a University. This is the time when one embarks on the adventure of putting to the test all that one has learnt from books and teachers on the touchstone of life's realities. This is a moment when one steps down from academic serenity to a world which demands practical efficiency, from the internal world of contemplation to the external field of action. It would be very proper at this time to bestow some thought on the several issues that will face us at this juncture.</p>
		<p>Fortunately we are citizens of no mean republice India has had a great cultural heritage and a continuous unbroken cultural tradition. It is timehonoured and ancient. But if antiquity had been its only virtue it would not have survived so long nor﻿ would we have admired it so much. It seems to have thriven on a hidden secret surprising vitality, an inexplicable resourcefulness, creative and dynamic in its upsurge. Whatever we may say of other ancient civilizations, so far as India is concerned, the witness of a past is unnecessary to testify to its present life and vitality. India today has been uttering eternal values in a new voice, expressing ancient truths in a new idiom and acting also in a way refreshingly new in the modern world. In the words of Will Durant, India has been teaching in return for conquest, arrogance and spoliation” the “ tolerance and gentleness of the mature mind, the quiet content of the unacquisitive soul, the calm of the understanding spirit and a unifying, pacifying love for all living things.” The spiritual achievement of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the fertilizing currents of thought and spiritual discipline of Sri Aurobindo, the philosophy of Satyagraha of Mahatma Gandhi, the Bhoodan Yajna of Vinobaji, the popularity of Nehru's Pancha Seela in the international world are a few of the recent illustrations of India's perennial and beneficent vitality. India can still be the holy land and a land of heroes.</p>
		<p>We, the people of Karnataka, have no doubt developed certain distinctive cultural features of our own. We have our own language, literature, art and ways of life. We have had a long history of our own and an individuality of our own. There is no gainsaying this fact. But we should not forget for a single moment that we are parts of a greater unit called India. When we speak of Karnataka culture﻿ what we really mean is Indian culture as it has manifested and developed in the region called Karnataka. We cannot conceive of a Karnataka culture apart and antithetical to Indian culture. At the same time what we call Indian culture is nothing apart from the regional cultures of Kannada, Andhra, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati and so on. India is one organism and these are its limbs that derive their sustenance from it. We must not forget that the culture of India has many strands in it. We may better liken it to a confluence in which many streams mingle and tumble sweetly together enfolding each the other. In this confluence of several streams there has emerged a fundamental cultural unity from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Historically, politically, economically and socially. our interests as a people are welded together. If in the face of this ineradicable fact we begin to fan the flames of animosity based on doubtful ethnological fictions like Arya, Anarya, Dravida, Naga, Sindhu and so on, we are in for trouble and inviting home the passing devil. There is nothing more ludicrous and unscientific at present than to seek to determine as to what proportion of our blood and sinews are Aryan and what Non-Aryan.</p>
		<p>Apart from these we have ideologies which stress the individual at the expense of society and those that stress society at the expense of the individual. This is based on a vicious dualism. The individual's well-being is wrapped up with the well-being of the whole society. The individual and society stand in﻿ indiscerptible relation. The attempts to pit the individual against society and society against the individual are misconceived and dangerous in the extreme. The individual without society is a fish out of water and society without the individual is an empty abstraction. Therefore when we speak of individual well-being we mean social well-being and <em>vice versa.</em></p>
		<p>But what is meant by the well-being of the individual or society? People are likely to hold different views as to what constitutes well-being. Is it to be measured in terms of material comfort or moral welfare? Buddha spoke of both. Material comfort at the expense of moral welfare spells disaster. Equally so the neglect of material prosperity in the name of spiritual well-being. We must aim at both, <em>Abhyudaya</em> and <em>Nishreyas,</em> material prosperity and spiritual welfare. The good must be made pleasant and the pleasant must be made good. The pleasant divorced from the good poisons the well-springs of life whereas the good divorced from the pleasant dries up the fountain of life. It is this same truth that is expressed by the Upanishads in its doctrine of the <em>Koshas.</em> Harmony at all levels of our being is the keynote of human perfection. It is only then that life becomes full and fructifying. Man's individual existence must be the result of an integration of the physical, the biological, the psychological and the spiritual. It is only when we attain this balance of our being that we can be said to have achieved life's purpose. When this balance becomes upset for some reason or the other, life becomes a gamble and a waste. The wreckage of it becomes disgusting. Our life must therefore be hitched to a star without our being content to be a clod of earth, the star of perfection, freedom, happiness and immortality. How far have all our endeavours in the several fields of life's activity helped us in this onward march is a vital question we have to put to ourselves.</p>
		<p>Life is an experiment. We must approach it in the spirit of an experimenter following the method of trial and error. We must consolidate and register the progress that we have made at every step. Life is both a science and an art. We have in us the potentialities of being bondsmen or free. It is only when we have become masters of ourselves that we can call ourselves really free. Let us gauge our present-day achievements in the light of this ideal of self-mastery or emancipation of the human spirit from all obstacles that hamper its upward striving.</p>
		<p>We have now in our possession the knowledge of atomic energy. We are fully aware of its terrific nature. But unfortunately we lack the inner restraint or refinement which is absolutely necessary to keep it in leash. Man is threatened with self-destruction by the very Frankenstein he has himself raised. He has been finding it difficult to bottle up the genie. It is a paralysing fear that has overtaken many who argue for our going back to an age of primitive simplicity when we knew no science of this type. But this is a symptom of weakness. The solution does not lie in escapism. "We must face the situation with all the strength of our souls. We﻿ must learn to control ourselves and control these energies and use them for constructive purposes. This is already within the range of practical possibility. It behoves our scientifically trained alumni to bend all their energies to humanize the knowledge and agencies of science and harness them to the moral and spiritual elevation of mankind. This shall be the social function of science</p>
		<p>We are today a free nation. Ample opportunities are gradually unfolding themselves to which we must gear our intellectual and technical abilities. We have now been given the privilege of being the architects of our own destiny without the interference of others. Now is not the time for our dissipating our energies in-unseemly squabbles arising out of sectarian, communal, provincial and linguistic prejudices. At least let the coming generation steer clear of these devitalizing elements. Let them be inspired by a loftier national spirit without succumbing to these petty fissiparous tendencies. Let them be inspired by a radiant vision of the future India, an India, united, pure, strong and free. There is no task more glorious than to build it up from now. To be alive now to do this is bliss. If we lose this vision, we perish. Freedom then becomes a curse instead of a blessing.</p>
		<p>We have given to ourselves a democratic constitution. We cannot go back on that. Democracy is the most difficult form of Government to practise. It can be successful only when we develop a sense of duty, an attitude of equality, a spirit of toleration and sweet persuasiveness. Democracy is based on﻿ the principle of persuasion and not coercion. We must realize.as at no time before how very responsible we are to grow now. We must endeavour to make democracy work in its true spirit and not be content with maintaining its external forms. We must not get deluded that we have the substance of democracy when we are only having its forms. The consciousness of duties must take precedence over the consciousness of rights.</p>
		<p>We have learnt many things from the west-many arts by which we could intellectually improve. Literacy, Cheap books, Newspapers, Cinema all belong to this group. But the necessary sense of discrimination of what is good and bad in them has still not become our asset. The other day the Central Assembly passed a law banning terror films. Unless We develop in the people a sense of discrimination and proper appraisal of what is really good or bad in these exotic products, more harm than good is done by them. In this respect also the new graduates must establish a healthy example for others to follow.</p>
		<p>Let us now for a moment cast a glance at ourselves in Karnataka. We had so far been parcelled out into several shreds but now with the emergence of the new State of Mysore on the ist of November 1956 we have become united. This is a great event in our history and this has filled our people's minds with fresh hopes and aspirations for the future. Legally, politically and geographically we have now become one. But this by itself will not suffice. Our hearts and minds must unite. Without any mental reservations we must come together and pull﻿ ourselves together. Let the one United Karnataka So govern herself that she shall bring fame and glory to the India which is our common motherland.</p>
		<p>The architects of India's future destiny are these young men and young women whom I witness before me. I see in each one of them tremendous potentialities. May their lives shine forth like a steady, pure flame shedding illumination on all around them. Let them hold in iheir hands undimmed the torch of freedom and purity and march on in bold strides joining the procession of Humanity towards its divinely appointed destiny.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">YOUR HIGHNESS THE CHANCELLOR, Mr. VICE<br />CHANCELLOR, FELLOWS AND GRADUATES OF THE MYSORE UNIVERSITY,</h1>
		<p>IT is a privilege and an honour to participate in this function of the year, and I am most grateful to the Chancellor and the Members of the University for inviting me to it. It was with no little concern and diffidence that I accepted your kind invitation. I was doubtful then, and more so now, about my adequacy, in substance and eloquence, to present a Convocation Address worthy of this great institution. And this feeling is sharpened when I think of the distinguished men who have addressed in the past Convocations of this University. All the same, it is always most stimulating and encouraging to meet a gathering of young students, teachers and scholars engaged in the pursuit of knowledge and discovery, and all that it implies. The cultivation and exploration of knowledge, if it is to lead to results of real value, has to be a continuing process, vigorous, courageous and relentless. We are assembled here because we share in common our dedication, to the best of our strength and ability, to knowledge and truth. We recognise that <em>education</em>-and it is a process which must continue throughout life and not end abruptly on graduation-is an integral and vital element of a worthwhile and purposeful life.</p>
		<p>To the young men and women who have received their <em>degrees</em>today I offer my warm felicitations. I wish them a happy and fruitful life, and express the﻿ confident hope that they will make a worthy contribution towards the progress and prosperity and security of our great country.</p>
		<p>Today's Challenge :</p>
		<p>We live in unusual times, and this is true in more than one way. The thought which is uppermost in our minds today is of the challenge, unprovoked and sinister, to our security and freedom. That a great country with which we have been at peace for centuries, should have suddenly invaded our land and, confronted us with naked force, casting aside all pretence of civilised behaviour, is not only a crime against us but a crime against humanity and decent behaviour. What we should do to make freedom endure? That is the most important question which faces us. In the stirring and noble words of our Prime Minister:</p>
		<p>“Every generation has to fight anew the battle for freedom. Otherwise we grow soft and forget the basic values of life and freedom and tend to lose their essence. My generation had the inestimable privilege of serving under Gandhiji in the struggle for our freedom.</p>
		<p>Now a chance comes to all of us and, more especially, to the young to test their mettle and their patriotism. Already the wonderful response of the people of the country has shown our basic strength. Let this not be frittered away in petty things. Let this challenge be considered an opportunity and be met with strength, dignity, discipline and fortitude, so that out of this trial new and better India might be fashioned by the efforts and sacrifices of her children.</p>
		<p>There are many ways of serving this cause, and many more will be pointed out to us from time to time. Meanwhile, I should like all our University students to join the National Cadet Corps or the N. C. C. Rifles to get some elementary training. It may be necessary to have higher training later on. Let us live a life of some austerity and save as much as we can, so that our savings might help in increasing the nation's effort.</p>
		<p>Let us continue our education and training and prepare for the time when more is required of us.”</p>
		<p>Problems facing Universities :</p>
		<p>In the modern world, characterized by its increasing dependence on science and technology the universities hold a unique place. Their role and influence in determining the pace of progress (material, cultural and even spritual) can be, and in most cases is, both powerful and profound. Perhaps, there is no other institution or agency which in this respect is of comparable importance. It is the mission of universities to provide society with good and competent men and women trained in arts, science and technology, medicine, agriculture and other professions; and who, above all, are imbued with a sense of altruism, openmindedness and dedication. “A university stands for humanism, for tolerance, for reason, for the adventure﻿ ideas and for the search for truth. It stands for the onward march of the human race towards even higher objectives. If the universities discharge their duties adequately, then it is well with the nation and the people.”</p>
		<p>It is common knowledge that in education many of the fundamental problems with which we are concerned also face most countries, including the more advanced ones. Almost everywhere there is a marked increase in student enrolment to meet the requirements of expanding economy and other national needs; there is an acute shonage of teachers partly because of the increasing drift to industry and other avenues of public and private employment, and the shortage is further accentuated because of rising student numbers; there is much serious concern that in many places there is too much teaching' but relatively too little of 'good teaching and far too little of good research; there is the problem of specialization and insulation, and its relation to inter-disciplinary communication and the needs of liberal education; there is too much fragmentation and compartmentalization of knowledge, and not only are there wide gulfs separating humanities, science and technology, but the bridges are far too few and even these are often unused; and there is the important and pressing problem of collaboration and mobility of staff between universities, national laboratories, industry and also Government scientific departments. There is also the complex and far-reaching problem of university autonomy, of relative freedom from Government control and outside interference, of freedom﻿ from internal strife and bigotry, and this can take many different and ugly forms.</p>
		<p>Raise quality and reduce wastage :</p>
		<p>In a sense the central problem facing us, which is basic to everything else in the field of higher education (in fact, all education), is to <em>raise quality and 'reduce wastage,</em> particularly that resulting from large-scale failures, of the order of fifty percent, at examinations. To progress in this direction is most important that we take urgent and energetic steps to raise the quality and strength of the teaching staff, to make available good books at reasonable prices within the easy reach of our students, and to provide reading-seats’in libraries and day-students homes' for a substantial proportion of our students. And in whatever we do, the student must always be at the centre of our attention.</p>
		<p>“The quality of a university is always in direct proportion to the quality of its teachers." To attract and retain in the teaching profession men of outstanding ability and character reasonable salaries are important, but by no means everything. Opportunities of professional advancement, possibility of migration from college to university, and between universities, recognition by society of the value and importance of the teaching profession, would go a long way ip attracting to the profession reasonable proportion of men and women of high intellectual ability and character. Generally, it should be made possible for a teacher to carry with him his provident﻿ fund, leave and other benefits in moving from one university or college to another.</p>
		<p>University is a Society dedicated to learning :</p>
		<p>A university is, above all, a society of students and teachers dedicated to the pursuit of learning, accumulation of knowledge, its transmission to succeeding generations and exploration of new knowledge. A good teacher is a continuing student.' A university combines education and discovery, teaching and research. In this combination lies its peculiar strength. The experience of over a century beginning first with the German Universities has conclusively demonstrated that teaching and research flourish best in combination and they both wither in isolation. The best of either is achieved in an environment where both are cultivated.</p>
		<p>As we all recognize it is of the utmost importance to ensure that the highest standards are observed in the recruitment of teaching staff. Appointments should be made on the basis of academic merit and suitability, uninfluenced by considerations of caste, regionalism and other extraneous factors. At one of its recent meetings, the University Grants Commission after carefully considering the matter observed that “appointments of teachers in the Universities should be governed by their suitability for the work to be done by them (that is on the basis of academic achievement, personality and character), and no consideration should be given to factors such as caste, creed and place of birth.”</p>
		<p>Every possible encouragement should be given to﻿ young men of ability to join the teaching profession. If a person has outstanding work to his credit, young age should be no disqualification for appointment to University Chairs. In fact, other things being equal, it is in the interest of university education that young men still in the most creative period of their life be appointed to high academic posts.</p>
		<p>Feed-back process :</p>
		<p>Education provides a good illustration of the "feed-back’ process. If things are so organised that every year an appreciable number of our best young men join as teachers in our schools and colleges we shall have continually escalating improvement in education. On the contrary, if we plough back into our schools and colleges young men with less than average ability, then standards would rapidly (exponentially) go down as years roll by. The key to a continuous improvement of standards is to feedback into the teaching profession every year a reasonable proportion of the best young men turned out by the universities.</p>
		<p>Student admissions :</p>
		<p>It is hardly necessary to say that in universities and colleges admission of students should be on the basis of merit--and this may not be narrowly interpreted in the sense of percentage of marks secured at examinations--uninfluenced by considerations not in keeping with the essential character and ethos of a university. Apart from other things, this is necessary if we are to make the best use of our very limited﻿ facilities and resources for higher education. As the National Integration Council has observed : “Admissions to the universities should not be denied on considerations of place of birth, residence, caste or creed (except in so far as any reservations have been provided under the Constitution).”</p>
		<p>Academic Standards are international:</p>
		<p>In the field of university education, specially at the postgraduate level and research, we must aim at the highest international standards. Nothing less is or can be worthwhile. There are no, and can be no, local or regional standards as academic standards by their very nature are international. International standards in scholarship and research are not easy to achieve, but even in underdeveloped countries one sometimes comes across buildings and equipment which compares with the best anywhere. This is only a reflection of the simple fact that whereas in the first case we have to spend thought, in the second case it is primarily a question of spending money. Money is relatively much easier to spend than thought, specially when it is someone else's money.</p>
		<p>Knowledge, as has been aptly said, is an international commodity.' The universities share a common stock of knowledge and a common attitude towards its cultivation and progress. They share in and contribute towards creating a common brotherhood of learning and scholarship. This is a thing of special value and significance in the "age of the atom" and ballistic missiles.﻿</p>
		<p>The Unprecedented peril:</p>
		<p>The mention of atomic age immediately calls to our minds the unprecedented peril, both in depth and extent, which faces mankind today in the shape of a possible misuse, deliberate or accidental, of nuclear knowledge. Indeed, nothing less than civilisation and human survival are at stake. If this simple fact is not as widely apparent and forcefully realised as it ought to be, it is largely because there has not been enough serious and sustained effort to inform us about it. As Professor Le Gros Clark observed in his Presidential Address to the British Association last year (1961): “For, let us not deceive ourselves, the frightening question is now beginning to present itself whether the civilisation which mankind has slowly and laboriously built up over a period of many thousands of years. can avoid disastrous dissolution as the result of uncontrollable (or, at any rate, uncontrolled) struggles for political power or economic, superiority, and, indeed, whether the human species can avoid at least partial extinction by the misapplication of its own ingenuity.”</p>
		<p>The two big power-blocks possess nuclear weapons totalling many thousands of megatons (TNT equivalent) in constant readiness for immediate deployment, within hours to minutes, largely against city-targets and population centres. (At the present level of nuclear stalemate military targets' are hard or difficult to locate, and for that reason less 'paying' than city targets.) This balance of terror' with hideous weapons of colossal mass-destruction hanging over﻿ mankind creates a state which is too precarious and too unstable to exclude the possibility--in fact, much more than mere possibility, of the occurrence of some unpredictable spontaneous event' or accidental happening, a sort of political Brownian motion, escalating into a full-scale nuclear war. Given enough time, say ten years, but some think this is too long, the situation is almost certain to explode. It is hardly necessary to stress this point with the Cuban crisis still fresh in men's minds. The crisis in this case was resolved happily because of exceptional courage, statesmanship, and mankind's good fortune.</p>
		<p>It is an interesting and significant thing that statistical analysis, carried out by L. F. Richardson, of the distribution of wars through history seems to fit in with the laws of chance (Poisson distribution):<em>Chance and not wills of men seem to govern the incidence of wars.</em></p>
		<p>Knowledge and Wisdom :</p>
		<p>The balance of terror has to be replaced by common-links of co-operation and common endeavour in the pursuit of high ideals and goals. The present unfortunate and tragic situation is essentially a reflection of the widening gap between rapidly expanding scientific and technical knowledge on the one hand and 'political wisdom', statesmanship and ethical values on the other. Science and spirituality or atom' and non-violence are not in balance. It is this imbalance which mankind must seek to redress.</p>
		<p>The universities could make and ought to make a definite contribution in correcting the imbalance﻿ between science, technology and the humanities. They also have a role, no doubt very modest but nonetheless significant, in helping to bridge the gap between knowledge and wisdom. What the universities can do towards these great ends will be in direct proportion to their being and becoming, in pursuit of their true ideals, places where freedom to enquire boldly and readiness to doubt courageously, where knowledge and understanding and true humility go together and grow from more to more, and where the highest standards of scholarship, integrity and conduct expected and respected and cultivated.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY SRI PRAKASA<br />on Saturday, 5th Dec. 1964 FELLOW STUDENTS,</h1>
		<p>GRATEFUL as I am for the great honour that your esteemed Vice-Chancellor has done me in inviting me to address your Convocation this year, I must confess to a feeling of deep embarrassment as I stand before you in fulfilment of his wishes. I am close upon 75 years of age, and feel completely out of date. I realise only too well that the world is always for the young, and never for the old. If kindly death does not remove the aging ones in good time, the survivors must cheerfully withdraw themselves from the scene, and hand over charge to the young, of the affairs of life in all sincerity. By their persisting to take active part in the world's work when they become senile both in mind and body as I certainly feel I am, they can only make a nuisance of themselves without doing any good to anybody. As the wise, all understanding sheikh sa-adi has very rightly enjoined : " Bas kun azan pesh ki goyand bas”-“Say unto yourself 'stop' before others perernptorily tell you that they have had enough of you." I should like, therefore, to apologise for my appearence before you; and I have no doubt you will readily pardon me when you know that I am really not responsible for it. I tried very hard to avoid encumbering you with my presence, but your Vice-Chancellor would not take a 'no', and insisted on making elaborate arrangements to transport me from my home in Banaras, now called Varanasi; and so here I am.</p>
		<p>Standing before you, I cannot help recalling an old association of my family with your fair State. I cannot say whether my mention of it will amuse you or, in fact, irritate you. A remote ancestor of mine, seventh in direct ascent from me, Sah Manohar Das by name, was actually present as the com nissariat agent, banker and mint-master of the old East India Company, at the battle of Seringapatam -in 1799. He did, I fear, drag from there a fairly large fortune to his home in distant Kashi, and whence I too have come. At a time when there is a great deal of talk at least in the neighbouring State of Madras, of the exploitation of the South by the North, perhaps this incident may give them a. convenient handle to press further their accusations. Old incidents, however, amuse me personally a great deal, and I should like to express my gratitude to you for having helped this ancestor of mine to leave sufficient for his family to enable them to live in fair comfort for seven generations after him.</p>
		<p>You need, however, not be angry any more for the fortune is now spent; and with the enormous growth in the number of his descendants through the generations, high prices and heavy taxation, we despite your generosity in the past, are as badly off as any others can be in the land in the conditions of today. I may aiso perhaps be allowed to add that at that time, politically speaking, the inhabitants of Kashi Khand and those of Mysore, did not really regard themselves as citizens of the same﻿ country; and my ancestors, I fear, did not realise with the complications that the presence of the British had caused, that Hyder and Tipu were great patriots, heroes and statesmen, as later students of history have rightly proved them to be. My mind also sadly lingers on the tragic death, in October 1956 at Bangalore, of my dearly loved younger son Tapovardhan at the early age of 32, because of which I had always thankfully declined every invitation kindly extended to me to come to the State since then, till I was compelled to overcome my feelings and be with you here today.</p>
		<p>Setting aside these personal notes, for striking which you will please excuse me, I should like to complain again here as I have often done on similar occasions before at other places, against this system of our universities having an address delivered by an outsider at their Convocation time, particularly at the end of lengthy ceremonials after which everybody is anxious to go out to stretch his legs having received ihe degree for which he had primarily come. The number of universities in the country has been multiplying very rapidly, and so also the number of Convocation addresses. I myself must have delivered these at 15 different places during the last 12 years or so, and I really do not know what new things to say as the problems continue to remain the same that they were when freedom was ushered in the land seventeen years ago. I fear I can only repeat what I have said many times before.﻿</p>
		<p>To start with, the one thing that I am bound once more to press on the authorities of any university, as I have done several times earlier, is that they should always invite an old student of their own to address their convocations. I should also prefer such a person to be called who may not be regarded as having been what is called successful in life in the material sense, for then he would be able to give the best advice possible to the young graduates that are issuing out of his University, and tell them what to expect in the outside world, and how best to face the struggles of life with their unavoidable disappointments and frustrations. The so-called successful person is inclined to indulge in homilies and platitudes, and rather airily say that others can do as well as he has done if they would only have the necessary guts, which is patently incorrect for no one person can succeed unless heaps of others fail. Though it does happen that, thanks to Swaraj and my association with the Indian National Congress, I have held some socalled high offices, I have really myself not been a successful man in the ordinary sense of the word ; and if this ancestor of mine to whom I have referred above, had not left something for me at your expense, I do not know where I would have been. Thus I may say in all humility, that perhaps I am better placed than many others who have preceded me or may follow me on this platform, while speaking to you today.﻿</p>
		<p>The wise British scientist and philosopher of the nineteenth century, Herbert Spencer, has very rightly said that the purpose of education is to enable the individual to make himself most useful to himself, his family and his society; and I have no doubt that today as you are about to issue out from the portals of your University where you have enjoyed a more or less sheltered existence, your minds must be troubled as to what life holds for you, for you would now be thrown entirely on your own resources, and would come face to face with difficulties and dangers of all sorts. You will meet situations suchas you may perhaps not have imagined possible. You must be earnestly and anxiously thinking of how you are to find occupation that would be both congenial and gainful to enable you to rare a happy and healthy family; how you are to live in accordance with standards that you think right and proper for yourselves; how you are to obtain comfort and happiness, and how to inspire confidence and respect in your fellow men.</p>
		<p>You will see large numbers of our educated persons living unhappy lives, unable to find a proper niche in the economic edifice of society, and feeling that the education they had received, has been of no value to them, and that the trouble they had undergone in its pursuit and the sacrifices their parents had made for them, have been totally wasted. This unfortunate phenomenon with all its bitterness and sorrow, which is really quite wide﻿ spread, is due, to my mind, to the fact that a more or less uniform type of education has been given to us all, which has fitted us only for a very few professions-and that too such as had been newly introduced by the British in the land. These were already over-crowded; and with the demand of education becoming greater and greater as is but right in the setting of Swaraj, the over-crowding has become only the greater, because new avenues for employment have not been found, and what is worse, only these have come to be regarded as respectable and honourable, and others among whom are many of the older ones, have been relegated to the category of disreputable ones, beneath the dignity of the educated person to adopt and unworthy of the education he has received. It is but natural that the educated person should look for recognisedly respectable and honourable professions, with the result that many important lines of activity have been suffering badly owing to the neglect of them by those who should really have known better.</p>
		<p>Permit me to pause for a moment and to draw a distinction, if I may, between 'literacy' and ' education'. The two are very often inclined to be mixed up, but they really can be very different from each other. An illiterate man can be a really educated person, and a literate one, totally uneducated.</p>
		<p>Literacy 'simply means the skill to read and write, while education' means the capacity to do a piece﻿ of work properly and well. To take illustrations from the life of your own State, I am not one of those who think that the illiterate person who tames your wild elephants and boldly faces the tigers and snakes of your forests, or the illiterates who produce your marvellous works in ivory or sandalwood, are uneducated. Many of your educated persons would be unable to handle ivory and sandalwood, and would keep at a very safe distance from elephants, tigers or snakes. As Governor of various States in the country, I was called upon to make presents that were carefully chosen by the various Chief Ministers, to be given to visiting dignitaries from abroad. Curiously enough, I did not find even one article among them that was the product of an educated person so-called.</p>
		<p>Mysore works of ivory and sandalwood were among the most popular of these presents, and they are all the handiwork of the illiterate. From my own home towni of Varanasi, came the lovely brocades, and from Kashmir came shawls and carpets. These delighted the eyes of the foreigners who received them with unconcealed admiration ; but they were all products of the skilful fingers of the illiterate. The tragedy is that those who actually produce them, are not brought forward to present them as they ought to be, but the presents are made by public functionaries who have no idea as to how they are created. Literacy is necessary and must be made universal ; but when those who﻿ are called educated, feel very superior to the illiterates though they cannot do what these can do, they should not forget that our country is more famous abroad for the creations of the illiterate than those of the highly educated. I do not say all this to minimise the importance of the education that is given to us at our schools, colleges and universities. What I do want to stress is that we ought to have a wholesome respect for the objects produced and the work done by the illiterate; and that if we are really educated, we should not crowd. the few so-called respectable and honourable learned professions that the educated have so far adopted for themselves, but they should really be enabled by their education, to improve upon the work that the illiterates are doing today. We are also to honour the work and the worker, and not neglect them as we have been doing. Wandering through a village one morning, I stood watching with awe and amazement, the potter at his wheel turning out most useful household utensils from the lump of clay that he had put on a whirling wheel, with the help of his bare and extra-ordinarily skilful fingers. As I stood there wonder-struck, the potter turned to me and said: “This too is art, but who cares? Nobody recognises either us or our work." I felt humiliated for though a university, without proper appreciation of values, had made me a Bachelor of Arts, the university of life had made this man a true artist, and he was certainly very much more useful to society than I could pretend to be.﻿</p>
		<p>I have no doubt in my mind that the realisation of this fact should make us see to it that the illiterate artist is made literate without losing his art, and that adequate material return is made to him and a proper social position given to him for the services he renders to his fellow men. If only our educated persons will not spurn the professions that are regarded as humble and unworthy of them, and would so work them that they produce better stuff than the so-called illiterates do today, they would certainly justify their education. To take just one illustration: If the educated agriculturist with the help of his knowledge would produce one hundred maunds of wheat and rice where his illiterate ancestor produced only twenty, we would solve our food problem in a trice. Let it not be forgotten that in the setting of Swaraj, we have given ourselves the status of a Sovereign Democratic Republic. By 'Sovereign' we mean that we are the masters of our own destiny, and that no one has any right to interfere with us in any way. By Republic' we mean that no one is entitled to any public office merely because he is the child of his parents. These words are easily understood, and do not really apply to the ordinary man and woman so far as his or her daily life is concerned.</p>
		<p>The important word in the formula is democratic. It concerns us all, and is a significant fact in our day-to-day existance. Democracy, envisages an approximate equality of all citizens by giving an﻿ equal vote to everybody. It thus places an enormous amount of responsibility on us all, for we are ourselves responsible for everything that is happening. It is no use complaining against what the rulers may do because we have ourselves chosen them. If we have voted wrongly at elections, whatever the reasons we may be able to give for it, we must hold ourselves answerable for the results. Democracy has some very important ingredients which all of us must scd ilously and constantly remember. As all men are mortal, democracy does not regard anyone as indispensable, and feels that there will always be available in every society at any given time, proper persons in adequate numbers to perform the many tasks that the world requires. Democracy has prescribed the method of elections for the ferreting out of such people from odd corners as might be necessary. Thus the citizen with a vote becomes a very important person, and he has to exercise the privilege given to him, with the utmost care and caution. Democracy requires all matters to be discussed on a high intellectual level, when passion and prejudice have to be cast aside ; when emotions have to be kept under control; when everyone has to be given credit for good intentions and conclusions reached after careful discussion. Democracy also always respects majority; and when a majority decision is taken, it is regarded to be in the interest of the minority as much as of the majority itself, and should be cheerfully accepted. While the﻿ minority concedes victory to the majority, it is the bounden duty of the majority to see that no injustice of any sort is done to the minority, whether it is communal or linguistic. It is not enough for the majority to say that it is doing the right thing by the minority: it is only when the minority says so that the verdict can be accepted.</p>
		<p>Then Democracy also puts a seal of finality on decisions so taken, so that we might not go round and round the same thing, and keep constantly upsetting what has once been decided because it does not happen to suit the convenience of this person or that. Thus the spirit of democracy comes in the picture all the time, and applies to every individual in the home, in the social circle, in the economic sphere and in public life. We see around us that though we call ourselves a democratic people, we do not posses the essential qualities that can make us true democrats. That is what is causing most of the confusion in the land, against which we complain: indiscipline not only in educational institutions but also in legislatures themselves; corruption in many forms not only on the humble levels of life but even on the highest ; development of personality cults; and insecurity of life and property. A democracy is not pining for great men. In fact, it is always suspicious of tall poppies. It requires a high average of ordinary citizenship. If we are to make our democracy successful, we are not eternally to pray for some﻿ unique personalities to descend mysteriously from the skies to look after us, we have to look after us ourselves. The great thing in democracy is that it ensures permanency. Whoever may come or whoever may go, a democratic society goes on for ever. We in our country have seen endless changes of kings and kingdoms, and boundaries of States. We have suffered grievously from foreign conquests and internal turmoil. We do not want to repeat the sad pages of our history. That is why we have declared ourselves a democratic people. We have to be. worthy of our ideals, and we can be so only if we are all good citizens. If the country looks to the graduates of its universities, to show the way by precept and example-more by example than even by precept there is nothing to be wondered at.</p>
		<p>My great appeal, therefore, to the young graduates, would be to make themselves into good citizens. How can we be that? First of all, a good citizen must chose his work in life in good time, and then adhere to it through good report or evil, through success or failure. As the Bhagavad Gita says:</p>
		<p class="verse"><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-21">*</a></sup>Yogasthah kuru karmani sangam tyaktva, <br />Dhananjaya,</p>
		<p class="verse">Siddhyasiddhyoh samo bhutva, <br />samatvam yoga uchyate.</p>
		<p>(Perform action, O Dhanan-jaya, dwelling in union with the divine, renouncing attachments, and balanced evenly in success and failure ; equilibrium is called Yoga.)</p>
		<p>We are all very often prone to give up our work at the least set-back, feeling disheartened and discouraged. That is how so many of us are not able to do anything in life. A good citizen labours hard to learn all the details of his calling, and applies himself assiduously to the task needed for the same. We are all inclined to be very lazy, and a good citizen cannot afford to be lazy. He has his hours of relaxation and recreation as he must have, but above everything, he is a very hardworking person. Then a good citizen is a very responsible person. I fear we very greatly lack this quality in our country. We very readily make promises of all sorts in small and big matters, which we have no intention of fulfilling. If today we witness such wide-spread dislocation in our social and economic life, it is due entirely to no one being able to trust anyone else or be sure that the person who says he would do a thing, would actually do it. The one great characteristic that I found in our late Prime Minister Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, through almost half a century of close association with him as a colleague in public and a friend in private life, was his great sense of responsibility. Whether it was a small matter or big, when he undertook to do 'something, he always did it. Everybody could﻿ depend upon him for fulfilling what he had undertaken. This need not necessarily be a quality of a person who is great. In our own spheres, we can all be equally responsible. Our country will be a much better place to live in if only we were that.</p>
		<p>A good citizen is also a generous person. He does 'not keep his knowledge a close secret with himself. He shares it with others, so that there may be progress all round all the time. Our people have been very averse to parting with their knowledge, because of which so many of our arts and sciences have died, and each generation had to. re-discover what had already been discovered before. All progress, therefore, has been at a stand-still; and while others who originaily learnt arts and sciences from us. have very greatly advanced and progressed in them, we remain where we were many centuries back, and have now to learn from those whom we had taught. Then a good citizen has to be proud of his work. We are not so. We are always thinking that we deserved to have something more congenial and suitable than we have, and that we could have done other people's work better than they do that themselves. We thus spoil both ourselves and our work. To quote the Bhagavad Gita again,</p> 
		<p><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-22">*</a></sup>Shreyan swadharmo vigunah paradharmat swanushthitat,</p>
		<p>Swadharme nidhanam shreyah, paradharmo bhayavahah.</p>
		<p>(Better one's own duty, though destitute of merit, than the duty of another weli discharged. Better death in the discharge of one's own duty; the duty of another is full of danger.)</p>
		<p>A person who works hard so that he may do his work well; who is responsible so that all who deal with him, can depend upon him ; who is generous so that he hands over his work to future generations to improve; and who is proud of his work so that he feels happy in what he is doing and does it well, is a true citizen, and he alone can be a true democrat. If we want to make our democracy a success, we must all be such citizens.</p>
		<p>And whatever we learn or do not learn, let us make sure that we learn three things without fail. Above everything, we must learn patriotism. This must be sedulousiy, consistently, persistently taught to us at every stage of our life, training and education, for let there be no mistaking, we sadly lack this cardinal virtue. That accounts for all the endless squabbles we have over caste and creed, over language and region, and we really never take the right decisions because we do not go the right way. We are not prepared to keep our country above everything, and hence we miserably fail in most of the things we seem to do, not only in the larger matter of the solution of the food problem or the eradication of corruption, but even when the simplest tests are applied to us as we go about in · the concerns of our ordinary daily life. We have﻿ also to learn to perform our simple social and civic duties properly. We do not know what we owe to our neighbours. We do not know the art of carrying sticks and umbrellas in the public streets without hurting others, or looking right and left before we cross a road so as not to endanger ourselves and others. We throw orange and banana peels carelessly in public places, on which people slip and hurt themselves. We are supremely.indifferent to keeping our surroundings clean and sanitary. We do not look after our depressed and handicapped brethien, and are really cruel to animals. We must be taught the social sense so that every one may be assured that someone will come to his rescue when in need, and that no one will put unnecessary risks in the path of others directly or indirectly. .</p>
		<p>And then we must all learn good manners. Good manners are like oil that keep the machine of human relationship running smoothly, harmoniously and successfully. So many of us seem to think that politeness is sycophancy, and rudeness isindependence. With such ideas, we cannot go very far, orf man is a social animal. He cannot live alone. He must know how to conduct himself if he is to function properly in the society in which his life is cast. The ancients have very rightly enjoined:</p>
		<p><sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="999-aside.xhtml#id-23">*</a></sup>Shruyatam dharma sarvaswam, shrutva chaiva vadharvatam ;</p>
		<p>Atmanah pratikulani paresham na samacharet. </p>		
		<p>(Listen unto the very quintessence of all Dharma and religion, all righteousness and spirituality; and having so listened, thou shalt lay it securely to thy beart. Whatever thou findest unpleasant and unpalatable in the conduct of others towards thyself, thou shouldst know that the same is unpleasant and uopalatable in thy conduct towards others.)</p>
		<p>A patriotic person with a strong sense of duty by his subordinates and his fellow creatures, and blessed with courteous demeanour, is a good citizen. He is also thus a good democrat; and so we must all be if we are to prove worthy of the Freedom we have attained, the political status we have given unto ourselves, and the legacy we have inherited from ages past. Remember we have to make our own very special contribution to world thought and world endeavour. We cannot be satisfied with being a mere copy, of any other country, whether America or Russia.</p>
		<p>Graduates of the year, the tasks before you are indeed great. At the present moment, we are at the cross-roads of history, and the future entirely depends on how we condnct ourselves today, I pray that you may be able to raise happy and healthy homes for yourselves, that would give peace and rest to heart and head alike. May you find congenial and profitable occupations to ensure the fulfilment of your legitime te ambitions, and a proper place for yourselves among your fellow men.. May you succeed in whatever you undertake May your contacts with your Univessity ever remain close and cordial. May your alma mater be always sustained and surrounded by your love and service, and may she ever be proud of her sons and daughters who as good citizens of the land, are ever striving in their own lives and wherever they might function, so that its Unity may be consolidated and its Liberty kept inviolate for all time to come.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">CONVOCATION ADDRESS<br />BY<br /> DR. ZAKIR HUSAIN<br />15th December, 1966﻿﻿</h1>
		<p>Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
		<p>I am grateful to you for the honour done to me in asking me to address the Convocation of your University. I do not wish to have more than a just share of this honour, and sometimes I feel that I hava exhausted the small store of knowledge that I possess and must decline invitations to address convocations that are generously, perhaps all too generously and insistently, extended to me. But I have had the privilege of knowing Dr. Shrimali, the distinguished Vice-Chancellor of this University, for a long time and have too high an opinion of him to abide by any self-denying decision I may have taken in this matter. I am aware also of the history and the cultural traditions of Mysore. This is the State that offered the most effective, because the most intelligent opposition to the East India Company, the State which attempted to make resistance to inperialism an international issue, to train armies on modern lines and to provide them with the best available weapons. It is the State which first sponsored a scientific study of military organisation and modern strategy and tactics, published and available even now in book form. It is also the State whose craftsmen have been recognised as masters of detailed ornamentation, craftsmen for whom ivory and sandalwood and stone were equally pliant material, whose hands never failed them and whose eyes were never confused by the most complicated patterns. It was impossible, therefore, for me to resist the temptation to visit﻿ Mysore once again to pay my homage to the values which your Staie represents.</p>
		<p>But what I should say to you is quite another matter, Here I come up against the multitude of problems facing uş today, which are as baffling for me as for many of you. You must have heard it said that we are passing throug a very critical period. The people who say so perhaps mean different things and it is not comforting, at least intellectually, to find the same terms used repeatedly for different things, and sometimes also, no doubt, only because repetition involves no mental effort, I do not know of any period in the history of any country which could not, in some sense, be called critical We might also, when we look back at these two decades of our history fifty or a hundred years hence, find that the apxiety and the premonitions of disaster which we now feel were not quite justified. But we do need clarity of thought and consistency between belief and practice, between the ends we have in view and the means we adopt to achieve them.</p>
		<p>We need to make a clear distinction between State and Government. Loyalty to the State is unconditional. Loyalty to the Government is conditional on our belief that it is acting justly and in the interests of the State. But it is the Government that acts as the agent of the State, and not individuals and their opinions. Opposition to the Government in' a democracy must, therefore, be inspired and guided by a deeper loyalty to the interests of the State than may be apparent﻿ from the decisions or the actions of the Government. Law and order, for instance, is the interest of the State, not of the Government and if a complete breakdown of law and order takes place, it is not a defeat of the Government but a form of dissolution of the State. Citizens who take it upon themselves to oppose a democratic Government, must evince, in their actions, a higher regard for disciplined conduct and ordered living as an interest of the State than the Government they happen to oppose, they must be more thoughtful, far-sighted and consistent than those who happen to be holding the reins of Government. Democratic opposition ceases to be truly democratic if it becomes a kind of bull-baiting. It shou'd not consist in the adoption of the quickest and easiest means of provoking the Government to take violent action, so that retaliation and further provocation can be disguised as a demand for justice. Those of us who have the interest of the State at heart must seriously consider whether there is or is not a tendercy among us to confuse the Government with the State, and all unconsciously to give opposition to the Government a character and a form which is damaging to the interest of the State.</p>
		<p>Another distinction, not quite easy to appreciate but still one that it is essential to make, is the distinction between Government as such and the party in power which operates the machinery of Government. I trust that you will not mistake my meaning. . All that I wish to say is that in a democracy which wishes to ensure its survival conflicts of opinion and﻿ clashes of interest should not undermine the very idea of Government or the concept of obedience. We must develop the instinct of knowing when to stop and where to stop. Headstrong action, taken in anger or spite, breeds hysteria, and people who are not aware of the dangers of hysterical behaviour cannot serve as proper guardians of a democratic system.</p>
		<p>We must cultivate the babit of consequent thinking. If anything goes wrong, we must seek the real reasons, and not look for the most convenient targets. If Mysore appears to be cleaner than other towns, it is not only because the city fathers are most conscious of their duties; it is due also to the habits of the people. And if we find cities that are not clean, we can be sure that it is because the inhabitants do nothing to co. operate with the city authorities in maintaining proper standards of cleanliness, We hear vehement complaints of corruption. This is a phenomenon that calls for serious thinking and not vociferous indignation. We must analyse its causes objectively. If such an analysis reveals that there is a fairly large number of citizens who do not scruple to disregard the standards of honesty in public life, we must not pass hasty judgment on some other party alone. Perhaps if we turned our attention from the sensational cases that are written or whispered about in public to those that are hardly noticed because corruption is not a term we might apply to them, it will be possible to build up a strong sentiment in favour of﻿ honest dealing. We would not then be like fishermen who make nets to catch the biggest fish only and who find their nets broken through or carried away by their intended prey as the only reward of their ingenuity and labour.</p>
		<p>The habit of consequent thinking would stimulate us also to consider the ultimate results of whatever we do to assert our right to the freedom of civic self-expression. While we criticised, we would also search our hearts to make sure that we balance our criticism with an equal willingness to cooperate in the maintenance of high standards in our civic life. While we agitated, we would consider what harvest we shall ultimately reap from agitations that are ends in themselves and transform basically reasonable demands into obsessions. I do not believe there are many among us who would prefer disintegrated living to the necessary restraints of a democratic way of life. There should, therefore, also be many among us who realise the risks of a too inconsiderate exercise of the rights we possess, and who do all in their power to give proper direction to sentiments and energies that can become destructive if they get out of control.</p>
		<p>It is to the universities that we look for guidance in scientific and constructive methods of thought. I have myself spoken frequently in an idealistic vein about the role of universities and the duties of intellectual leadership which they must fulfil. Circumstances now make it urgent for us to give concrete forms to whatever idealism we claim for ourselves, as the university campus in the begining more and more reflects certain unpleasant aspects of the conditions outside. If we ever thought that we could reflect and decide at leisure, it is obvious that we cannot do so now. We have to act and act rightly and effectively. Not only youth but the country as a whole is filled with expectation. We have to press into the present moment what we believed could be done conveniently in a deeade or perhaps in the whole period of a teacher's service. And whatever we do now will be of much account and likely to provide a greater momentum for progress than similar actions might have done ten years ago or might do a year hence.</p>
		<p>It is necessary, I know, that we keep eyes on universities abroad and the systems they follow, but in fact each of our universities must find the solutions of its problems within the conditions that govern its working. There are universities in the world whose administration is in the hands of the state ; there are universities in whose working the state would deem it a sacrilege to interfere. Both represent workable systems, and one could say that academic freedom is not less evident in the one than it is in the other. There are universities in which the Rector or Vice-Chancellor is a mere figure-head, where a professor enjoys a higher status and would refuse to waste his time performing the ceremonial duties of a figurehead. There are universities in which the Vice-Chancellor possesses full academic and executive authority and is judged﻿ by the effectiveness with which he exercises this authority There are universities in which the government makes all the appointments and universities where all appointments are made by the university authorities. There are universities which look like cooperative associations of teachers and students and are proud of the amenities and prospects they offer, and there are universities which expect students to be mature enough to look after themselves, to select their courses of study, to choose their teachers and to hunt for books by themselves. We have in our own country universities following widely different patterns. The value of any system seems to depend not on theoretical merits but on the merits of those entrusted with its working, and if we bear this constantly in mind there is no reason why any defects that there might be in a system should not be neutralised or overcome.</p>
		<p>I am aware, of course, of the difficulties in which the universities have been placed for no fault of their own. There is overcrowding, and I can imagine earnest teachers feeling exasperated at the size of their classes. The process of change in the medium of instruction would in itself have bred a host of problems, but we have now in the multitude of students a relatively small number only of those who are mentally mature enough for university education. There is an acute shortage of books and necessary equipment. An atmosphere of depression is created because the existing opportunities of employment are obviously far too inadequate for those who have found﻿ admission to the universities. On the other hand the government, because of the overriding needs of development and defence, cannot fulfil the demands of education which it acknowledges to be just, and we have to be content with what it can give. The provision of employment is in a sense one of the functions of our State, but that responsibility cannot be unlimited. What, then, are we to do?'</p>
		<p>I have been deliberately brief and hasty in the enumeration of our diffculties. There is no advantage, it seems to me, in being elaborate and eloquent in such enumeration. It would be helpful, in the first place, if we habituated ourselves to seeing our difficulties in the context of our whole national life. They will then appear to be not an infliction but a challenge, and we shall realise that our problems are not our own only, but the problems of the whole nation. It is not only in education but in almost every sphere of activity that we find ourselves handicapped by lack of resources. Ours is a populous country, the vast majority of whose inhabitants have suffered from centuries of neglect, and we have now decided to give them the attention and the opportunities which they deserve. We should be proud of this decision and deem it an honour to assist in its fulfilment. Those working in the sphere of education have certain basic requirements which must be met to enable them to perform their functions. But they need also to cultivate that spirit which is not intimidated by lack of material aid and support, which discovers an opportunity in every﻿ difficulty and stimulates us to march forward with greater determination because of the many obstacles that have to be surmounted.</p>
		<p>One of the causes of the frustration many of us feel is that we overlook, if we do not mentally reject the fact that India is a poor country, and that our efforts are directed towards moving out of poverty and not at attaining any degree of affluence. We must make adequate provision for advanced teaching and research in science and technology - that is something which undoubtedly depends on resources. But the problem is different for the vast mass of those who obtain university education. Here what we need is intensity of concern with teaching and learning, spontaneous and self-directing cooperation between teachers and students in the communication and acquistion of knowledge, and a continuous and unsparing assessment. The universities must not examine their students only, they must examine themselves, and must not wait for others to tell them where they fail. The university administration should not be a bureaucracy but a cooperative democracy always discovering new means and methods of integration, and assisting individuals in the accomplishment of their academic aims; the measure of the persons in charge, whatever the charge they hold, must be their own intellectual and academic prestige, or their ability to enable others to devote themselves with singlemindedness to the advancement of knowledge. We shall then have a different atmosphere, the university will﻿ become a closely knit community, its administrative and organisational affairs will be settled in brief and purposeful discussions and merit will not have to canvass for the recognition due to it.</p>
		<p>In this integrated university community, the students and their interests will form an organic element of the whole. Their participation in political and social movements will not create discord but be in harmony with the aims and functions of the university. You will agree that till the attainment of independence it would have been tragic if students remained concerned only about their personal interests and careers and indifferent to the cause of national freedom. After independence it became obligatory on every student to concern himself as exclusively as possible with the development of his own particular aptitudes so as to acquire the greatest competence for serving the nation in his special field. It remained his duty, as a citizen-to-be, to keep himself informed of what was being done in the various spheres of national life, so that he could discover what his own preferences were and also find a place for himself where he was likely to be most useful; even the prospective politician should have looked for opportunities to train himself in organisation and persuasive oratory in constructive enterprises within the campus. Unfortunately, the mental adjustment necessary after independence was left to chance or undertaken in a haphazard way. Students were asked to interest themselves in welfare activities of some kind, or they were﻿ just barangued. Mostly they were left themselves. The earnest students--and let us never forget them when we talk about students-the earnest students did what was necessary and proper. The others suffered from lack of guidance within the campus and the absence of those pressures which, in a competitive society, make a man thoughtful in spite of himself. That may be regarded generally as the cause of what is now called 'students' unrest'. But would this or any other diagnosis of the causes of unrest in the least justify the forms which the unrest has taken? Would it entitle the students to assume the character of a social class, organising itself for self-assertion? And can this self-assertion include demands for the lowering of standards and the relaxation of academic discipline?</p>
		<p>I have posed these questions, but I am convinced in my own mind that we do not need to press for the answers. The unfortunate occurrences of recent months are a passing phase, and have been more the product of political tensions outside the university campuses than of discord within them. But the students, like the university authorities, must remember the circumstances under which he people as a whole are living: That they will one day take the place of their elders, as leaders and followers, as persons engaged in the manifold occupations of our political, social and economic life is an obvious physical fact, not an excuse for the demand of special treatment. On the other hand, the fact that students are students no reason to make them suffer from neglect. That transport services should﻿ be so regulated as to meet the needs of passengers, even if thay happen to be students, that buildings should be clean and kept in good repair, that food should be hygienically prepared and nutritious, that public servants should show proper attention and courtesy are generally admitted obligations, and something is seriously wrong if an agitation of any kind is neaessary to remedy laxity or indifference in the fulfilment of these obligations.</p>
		<p>I would like in the end to remind you, my young friends, that the suavival of democracy ia India depends on the means we adopt to attain ovr objectives. You will not find anything perfect and many things vary imperfect indeed, in your country, as in any other. It is your duty, as citizens, to strive to improve, to the best of your ability, whatever needs to be improved. But you must be scrupulous and circumspect in the means you choose for the performance of your duties. And you must, above all, try to understand. To fix the blame and call for punishment is seldom, if ever, an effeciive means of removing ills. Human nature and human habits of thought and behaviour cannot be easily changed, and those who desire change must also be those who excel in patience and perseverance. Above all, you must remember that setting a good example is abcut the greatest act of public service, even though its influence is not swift or obvious. It is not necessary for each of you to aim at great things; great things can be achieved, as it were without effort, where all are anxious to set an example in doing the small things. We shall not find leaders of supernatural capacity to bear the responsibility of this vast country of ours; that can be borne only by each of us showing that his shoulders are strong, his mind keen and clear, and his heart filled with patience, goodwill and hope.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY Pdt. H.N. KUNZRU<br />on Saturday, 18th Jan. 1969</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">I</span> AM grateful to the Mysore University for having done me the honour of asking me to address its Convocation this year. This is a great. responsibility but I have accepted it in a spirit of humility: I felt because of my deep interest in education and in our youth who will, in course of time, inherit the country, that I should take this opportunity of stressing the importance of education in shaping the lives of our young men and building up the strength of the country.</p>
		<p>I warmly congratulate the successful candidates. I hope that they will be able to find opportunities of using their talents for their own good and that of the country.</p>
		<p>The future of our.country depends on various factors but on none more than on education. In the recent debates in the French National Assembly on the reform of the universities, the Education Minister emphasized the importance of education by saying “The university is not a part of the nation. It is the nation itself.” What we are at any time is a reflection of the prevalent educational system. Political progress, economic development, social advance, the security of the country, all depend on the quantity and quality of education.</p>
		<p>Judged from this standpoint, there is a chasm between higher education as it is and what it should be. Excluding those in the Intermediate classes, the number of students receiving higher education in 1967-68 was about 20 lakhs. The number is not large in comparison with the population of the country. But the position with regard to the educational equipment of the freshmen and the efficiency of teaching is far from satisfactory. In 1965–66, taking both the annual and the supplementary examinations into account, the percentage of the successful candidates was 54.5 in the B.A. examination (Pass &#38; Hons.), 51.3 in the B.Sc. examination and 55.6 in the B.Com. examination. These figures show that about half the candidates failed in these examinations. The percentage of failures is disquietingly high. It is a serious reflection both c. the teachers and on the students.</p>
		<p>Our anxiety increases when we consider the standard of attainment of the graduates as shown by the divisions in which the successful students were placed. In the annual examination held in 1966, out of the 58,500 B.A.'s while only about 700 or 1.2 per cent passed in the 1st division, as many as 42,000 or 71.7 per cent passed in the 3rd division. For the B.Com. examination the corresponding figures were roughly 11,900, 251 (2.1 per cent) and 8240 (69.5 per cent). The results of the B.Sc. examination were distinctly better. Broadly speaking out of the 32,000 candidates who passed, as many as 4,400 or 13.7 per cent obtained the 1st division and only 13,600 or 42.4 per cent passed in the 3rd division. I should not, however,﻿ be understood to mean that we should be satisfied with the attainments of our science graduates.</p>
		<p>Owing to the low standard of education in India, our first degrees in Arts, Commerce and Science suffer in comparison with similar degrees in the educationally advanced countries. : “ What is really comparable ", says the Education Commission, "is our second degrees in Arts, Commerce and Science and the first degrees in agriculture, engineering and medicine with the first degrees given by Universities in the educationally advanced countries.”</p>
		<p>It should be noted that the enrolment in the Arts and Commerce faculties is much greater than in the Science faculty. In 1967-68 the enrolment in the first two faculties was 11.35 lakhs while that in the Science faculty was only 7.36 lakhs or about 40 per cent of the enrolment in all the three faculties. The Education Commission has justly said, “At present there is an over-production of graduates in arts and commerce..... and consequently, there is a growing incidence of unemployment among them.”</p>
		<p>It is clear from the facts cited above that a large percentage of the students who are admitted to the universities are ill-equipped to profit by higher education. It is no kindness to them to let them waste two or three precious years of their lives in the pursuit of an unattainable objec﻿tive. It is difficult to differ from the Education Commission when it says, “ A stage has, however, now been reached in the process of expansion when the policy of selective admissions will have to be extended to all sectors and institutions of higher education ... There is no escape but to link broadly the total enrolments in higher education to man-power needs and bridge the gap between these enrolments and the demand for higher education by adopting a policy of selective admissions.” The higher education of those who are unable to get admission to a college should be provided for through evening classes and correspondence courses as is done in countries like the U.S.A., the U.K., the U.S.S.R. and Japan. These courses should include courses in science and technology.</p>
		<p>The low standard of education in the universities is largely due to the deplorable condition of secondary education. After the completion of his secondary education, the successful student is fit neither to pursue his studies in a university nor to join a higher grade technical institution. For all practical purposes, secondary schools are the weakest link in the educational chain. Their radical improvement is imperatively called for in the interests both of the students and of the - country. The Education Commission has recommended the establishment of a National Board of School Education to bring this about. As the﻿ Board will be advisory and will have no power to assist selected schools financially to raise themselves to the required level, in my opinion it will fail in its purpose. In spite of the theoretical objections of the Commission, I think that the Board should be allowed, with the consent of the States concerned, to give carefully chosen schools financial assistance over and above what they receive from their governments, to enable them to reach the highest standard fixed by it so that in 20 or 25 years about 25 per cent of the Secondary Schools may be comparable to those in the advanced countries</p>
		<p>But even without waiting for the improvement of secondary education, it is practicable to raise the standard of university education in the arts faculty. While on the science side a student has to work for five or six hours every day, on the arts side, generally speaking, he is required to work for three hours only. The educational value of the first arts degree is thus lower than that of the corresponding science degree which too, as pointed out by the Education Commission, is none too high. In fairness to the arts students, their education should receive much greater attention in future and steps should be taken to raise the standard of attainment for the arts degree to the level of that required for science degree. Independent study, tutorial work and seminars are the means by which this objective can be﻿ realized. To change the present system will require considerable effort and expenditure but we owe it to the country to do the best we can for our students on whom its future depends. As I have already said, education is the key to progress in every direction, and it should be regarded as the most important factor contributing to the building of the nation. The money and effort required for its modernisation and development should, therefore, be regarded as an invaluable investment.</p>
		<p>There has been considerable discontent among the students for many years, manifesting itself in demonstrations and strikes which have frequently taken ugly forms. These have often been the · result of educational weaknesses. Increases in tuition or examination fees, which hit hard the increasing number of students from lower and middļe class rural families, unsatisfactory living conditions, difficult examination papers, want of contact between students and teachers, inadequate preparation of the students for higher education have all led to prolonged interruptions in their studies. Again, whenever a student is expelled for misbehaviour, the demand is put forward for the cancellation of the expulsion order and it is followed by a strike and rowdyism. In some universities students have also demanded the enrolment of as many students as seek admission. Factions among teachers also﻿ create difficulties for the universities. The teacher politicians are found from time to time to be involved in the strikes. Strikes backed by teachers are more prolonged and have more serious consequences than those led only by students. The strikes are sometimes politically oriented. In Northern India at least, political parties are believed to have been involved in the strikes and, in some universities, they have their cells among the students. They may not incite them to strike but when a strike has begun, their support to their groups lends political colour to the strike and the students become merely pawns on their chessboard.</p>
		<p>The students have genuine grievances, but the expression of their dissatisfaction, I regret to say, often takes highly undesirable forms. The absence of any system or method followed by the students has been noticed with great regret by some observers of the Indian educational scene. For instance, Prof. Shils of the United States, who has sympathetically studied the student movement in India, has said in <em>Higher Education and Student Politics in India, </em>“The hostile energy is there, the inflammability is there but the energy is primitive. It is not transfigured or disciplined by calculating intelligence or by a comprehensive vision, whether it be doctrinaire or idealistic, utopian or realistic.”</p>
		<p>The acadamic deficiencies which create discontent among the students have been referred to in﻿ its report by the Education Commission. They are, according to it," the mechanical and unsatisfactory nature of many curricular programmes ; the totally inadequate facilities for teaching and learning in the large bulk of institutions ; poor student teacher contact--many a student goes through the entire undergraduate course without exchanging a word with his teachers; the inefficiency and lack of scholarship on the part of many teachers and their failure to interest themselves in the students' problems...the prevalence of what has come to be known as teacher politics in some colleges and universities....” It goes on to say that “ the conditions of public life and the falling standards of discipline among the adults and a weakening of their civic consciousness and integrity" have also had an undesirable impact on the students. The removal of the educational deficiencies is urgently necessary to inspire the students with respect for their colleges and universities and their teachers. It is only teachers with a reputation for scholarship that can have the moral authority to give young people the moral guidance that is sadly lacking today. But improvement in this respect is bound to take time. The rapid expansion of higher education, like that of secondary education, has led to the establishment of inefficient educational institutions and the employment of inefficient teachers. I know that there are good and devoted teachers too in our universities and﻿ colleges, but there must be more of them. To attract more talented men to the teaching profession and to create contentment among the teachers it is necessáry, among other things, to pay them the salaries recommended by the Education Commission..</p>
		<p>Generally speaking, the participants in student revolts are those who are studying the liberal arts. The science and technology students who value the education they receive and understand the vital bearing of success in their studies on their future, have neither the time nor the inclination to take part in or encourage strikes and demonstrations. If the standard of education in the humanities is raised, as pointed out above, the arts students are likely to be as mindful of their studies and as sober as the science students are. .</p>
		<p>In addition to this imperative reform, deserving students should be helped to receive higher education. In the more important western countries, like the U.S.A., Great Britain, France and Germany, the educational policy is that no able boy or girl should be prevented by lack of means from following an advanced course of study. In Great Britain about 90 per cent of the university students are aided from public or private funds. In France and Germany the percentage of students receiving Government stipends is 67 and 55 respectively. In India also scholarships should be liberally given. A beginning may be made in﻿ accordance with the recommendations of the Education Commission. In the award of these scholarships the claims of poor but bright students should receive special attention.</p>
		<p>The measures suggested above in the interest of the students and the country should, in the natural course, reduce the frequency of violent outbursts but it will be too much to hope that they will be a cure for the present student indiscipline. We need not take a tragic view of the ebullition of feeling and rowdyism among the students. A wellknown proverb says, " Anyone under twenty who is not a radical does not have a heart; anyone over forty who still is one does not have a head." Young men will be young men, but we cannot make light of the resort to violence by striking students, which has taken the form of destruction of university property, burning of buses and cars and cinema houses, attackes on post offices and railway stations and, sometimes, manhandling of teachers and university officers. Recently in a northern university a student was stabbed on the campus and another student was thrown off the roof of a two-storey hostel. Severe notice should be taken of such conduct. The students should not be allowed to feel that they are a privileged class and that they are not amenable to the law which is applicable to the rest of the community.</p>
		<p>The cure for this malady depends on the courage and understanding of the students themselves,﻿ They are assuredly friends of democracy whose existence depends upon the appreciation of its ethies by the younger generation. They should, therefore, respect the democratic process where their own interests are concerned. The large majority of students who realize the value of knowledge at the present time and want to carry out their studies have so far given in to an organised and determined minority whose actions have unfortunately received widespread publicity. It is their duty to resist the attempts of the minority which wants to disrupt their studies. Their failure to do so will result in the developnient of institutionalised terrorism or lead to prolonged discontinuance of studies in the colleges and universities.</p>
		<p>Widespread student revolts in other countries, particularly in Europe and the United States, have sometimes been referred to almost as a justification for the unrest among Indian students. But violence déserves condemnation wherever it may manifest itself, and well-known educationists have, as a matter of fact, condemned it at least in some of the important western countries. It has also been said that the revolt is due to the dissatisfaction of the youth with the ideas of the older generation. I should welcome the rejection of old ideas, for absence of adjustment to changing circumstances would lead to stagnation and decay, if I discerned any new ideas that might be expected to take the place of the old. But, for all its﻿ seeming radicalism, the student movement in India does not appear to be actuated by any large social or political purpose, as it was during the struggle for national freedom: it is now linked to no ideology.</p>
		<p>The language question has a vital bearing on higher education and the unity of the country. It is admitted on all hands that theoretically the mother tongue should be the medium of instruction. But the regional languages unfortunately are underdeveloped. There is hardly any literature in any of them, not merely on science and technology but on such subjects as history, politics, economics and sociology. The Central and State authorities and the educationists will have to work together for a long time to make them capable of expressing modern ideas, and become fit. vehicles of modern knowledge. In the interest of education, there should be a phased transition from English to the regional languages as media of instruction.</p>
		<p>This question should also be considered in relation to national integration. It will be readily agreed that the inter-state migration of students and teachers is highly desirable from the point of view both of education and of national unity. This will, however, not be possible if the regional languages are the sole media of education in universities. If this is done, the Central universities which are at present regarded as all﻿ India universities will be so only in name in future. No student in one state will be able to benefit by the scholarship of an able teacher in any other state unless he learns the language in which instruction is given in the university to which the teacher belongs. The teachers also will be prevented by the linguistic barrier from seeking employment, delivering lectures or taking part in examinations in other universities. The principal task of education should be to make our young men and women feel that they are Indians first and anything else afterwards; but prematurely making the regional languages the media of instruction in universities will actually make them parochial and give the first place in their thoughts to their states. I have no doubt that is important universities whose facilities are taken advantage of by persons in different parts of the country, there should be room in future also for teachers and students coming from states other than those in which they are situated. It is necessary for this that provision should also be made for teaching in a language which educated men all over the country can easily understand, which is English. This will lead to extra expenditure, but for a very good purpose. As the purpose is national, the central government should, if necessary, bear a part of the expenditure.</p>
		<p>Hindi aspires to replace English as the common language of the intelligentsia. I have every hope﻿ that it will be able to realise its ambition if its advocates act with moderation and remove the impression among the non-Hindi speaking people that they are linguistic imperialists trying to force their language on them. But it is obvious that Hindi will take a fairly long time to establish itself as the medium of communication between educated men throughout the country.</p>
		<p>English is a help to us at present in maintaining the unity of India and is an important language of international communication. It also provides us with a window on the world. It enables us to keep in touch with new developments in science. technology and the humanities. Its knowledge is, therefore, indispensable to the progress of the country and arrangements for teaching it should be greatly improved. Learning it properly should not be regarded as a hardship. In many countries, boys and girls are required to have a good knowledge of at least one internationally recognised language. The State governments are doing a great injustice to our boys and girls and prejudicing their future by neglecting this important question. They must bear no small part of the responsibility for the present acute discontent among the students because of the poor education which they receive in the secondary schools.</p>
		<p>Notwithstanding what has happened, I have faith in our young men and women, who will provide the country with its future leaders. They﻿ are full of idealism and enthusiasm. If they have the right kind of leadership, they can bring about a transformation of the educational system and be a powerful instrument for imparting a new moral vitality to our hidebound society. I lay special stress on this because this is Gandhiji's birth centenary year. He wrote in Young India in 1931, “I shall work for an India in which the poorest shall feel that it is their country in whose making they have an effective voice; an India in which there shall be no high class and low class; an India in which all communities shall live in perfect harmony"; and in his constructive programme he emphasized the necessity of our working wholeheartedly for Hindu-Muslim unity and the removal of the disgrace of untouchability from our society. We should add the uplift of the tribal people to these items. I ask our young people to strive in accordance with their circumstances to bring into existence, the India of Gandhiji's dreams. Let them pledge themselves like the spartan youths to pass on the country to the coming generation better and happier than it is. They can have no greater happiness than the happiness of knowing that through their efforts others are happy.﻿</p>

		<p>ನನ್ನನ್ನು ಇಲ್ಲಿಗೆ ಈ ಘಟಕೋತ್ಸವಕ್ಕೆ ಆಮಂತ್ರಿಸಿದುದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಮೊಟ್ಟ ಮೊದಲು, ಮೈಸೂರು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯದ ಅಧಿಕಾರಿವರ್ಗಕ್ಕೆ ನಾನು ನನ್ನ ಹೃತ್ಪೂರ್ವಕ ಕೃತಜ್ಞತೆಯನ್ನು ಸಲ್ಲಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ. ಈ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾ ನಿಲಯದ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ ನಾನಾಗಿದ್ದರೆ ಒಳ್ಳೆಯದಾಗುತ್ತಿತ್ತೆಂದು ನನಗೆ ಅನಿಸು ತದೆ. ಅದು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾಗಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಆದಾಗ್ಯೂ ನಾನು ಈ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯದ ಪದವೀಧರನಿದ್ದೇನೆ. ಕೆಲವು ವರ್ಷಗಳ ಹಿಂದೆ ಮೈಸೂರು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾ ನಿಲಯ ನನಗೆ ಗೌರವ ಡಿ. ಎಸ್ಸಿ. ಪದವಿಯನ್ನಿತ್ತಿತು, ಅಂತೇ ನಾನು ಈಗ ನಿಮ್ಮವರಲ್ಲಿ ಒಬ್ಬ. ಆದರೆ ಮೈಸೂರು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ನನಗೆ ಚಿಕ್ಕಂದಿನಿಂದ ಅಪಾರ ಗೌರವವಿದ್ದಿತು. ನಾನು ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ ಯಾಗಿದ್ದಾಗಿನಿಂದಲೂ ಈ ಭಾವನೆ ನನ್ನಲ್ಲಿ ಮನೆಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡಿತ್ತು. ಇದಕ್ಕೆ ಕಾರಣವೆಂದರೆ, ಮೈಸೂರು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯವು ಕನ್ನಡ ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ-ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಸಂರಕ್ಷಿಸುವ ಭದ್ರ ಕೋಟೆಯಾಗಿತ್ತು. .</p>
		<p>ಉತ್ತರ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದಲ್ಲಿ ಆಗ ಈ ಸೌಕರ್ಯಗಳಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ. ಯಾಗಿದ್ದಾಗ ನಾನೂ ಕನ್ನಡ ಕವಿಯಾಗಬೇಕೆಂಬ ಮಹತ್ವಾಕಾಂಕ್ಷೆ ಯನ್ನು ತಾಳಿದ್ದೆ. ಆದರೆ ಈ ಆಕಾಂಕ್ಷೆಗೆ ನೀರೆರೆಯುವವರಾರೂ ಆಗ ಇರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ನನ್ನ ಕವಿತೆಗಳನ್ನು ನೋಡಿದ ಮಹನೀಯರು, ನಾನು ಇನ್ನೂ ಚಿಕ್ಕವನೆಂದೂ, ಕವನಗಳನ್ನು ಬರೆಯುವ ಮೊದಲು ಕನ್ನಡದಲ್ಲಿಯ ಮಹಾ ಕಾವ್ಯಗಳನ್ನು ಆಳವಾಗಿ ಅಭ್ಯಸಿಸಬೇಕೆಂದೂ ಉಪದೇಶಿಸಿದರು. ಮುಂದೆ ನಾನು ಕವಿತೆಗಳನ್ನು ಬರೆಯುವುದನ್ನು ಬಿಟ್ಟಿ ನಲ್ಲದೆ, ಕನ್ನಡ ಗ್ರಂಥಗಳ ನೋದುವುದನ್ನೂ ಕೈಬಿಟ್ಟೆ, ನನ್ನ ಕನ್ನಡ ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ ಸಾಧನೆಗೆ ಅಷ್ಟಕ್ಕೇ ಇತಿಶ್ರೀಯಾಯಿತು. ಉತ್ತರ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದಲ್ಲಿ ಆಗ ಕನ್ನಡದ ಅಭ್ಯಾಸ ಒಂದು ತುದಿಗೆ ಬರಿ ಪ್ರಾಥಮಿಕ ಶಾಲೆ ಇಲ್ಲವೆ ಇನ್ನೊಂದು ತುದಿಗೆ ಎಂ. ಎ. ಡಿಗ್ರಿ ವರ್ಗಗಳಿಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಸೀಮಿತವಾಗಿತ್ತು. ನಡುವಣ ಹಂತದಲ್ಲಿ ಅದರ ಗಂಧವಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ. ಹೀಗಾಗಿ ಮುಂಬಯಿ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾಲಯದ ಪದವಿ ಪಡೆಯಲು ವಷ್ಟರಲ್ಲಿ ಕನ್ನಡದ ಅಭ್ಯಾಸದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ನನ್ನ ಉತ್ಸಾಹ ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ಕುಂದಿಹೋಗಿತ್ತು,</p>
		<p>ಆದರೆ ಮೈಸೂರು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಕನ್ನಡದ ದೀಪ ಎಂದಿ ನಿಂದಲೂ ದೇದೀಪ್ಯಮಾನವಾಗಿದೆ. ೧೯೧೬ನೇ ಇಸ್ವಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ದಿವಂಗತ﻿ ಭಾರತರತ್ನ ಎಂ. ವಿಶ್ವೇಶ್ವರಯ್ಯನವರ ದೂರದರ್ಶಿತ್ವದಿಂದ ಪ್ರಾರಂಭವಾಗಿ, ತನ್ನದೇ ಆದ ವಿದ್ವತ್ತು-ಸಂಶೋಧನಗಳ ಪರಂಪರೆಯನ್ನು ಮೈಸೂರು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯ ಬೆಳೆಯಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿತು. ಉಳಿದ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಗಳ ಕಣ್ಣು ಕುಕ್ಕುವಂತೆ, ಪ್ರತಿಭಾವಂತ ಪ್ರಾಧ್ಯಾಪಕರ ಸೇವೆಯನ್ನು ದೊರಕಿಸಿ ಕೊಂಡು ಉತ್ತಮ ಸ್ಥಾನವನ್ನು ಗಳಿಸಿತು. ಶ್ರೇಷ್ಠ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನಿಗಳನ್ನೂ, . ಅರ್ಥಶಾಸ್ತ್ರಜ್ಞರನ್ನೂ , ತತ್ವಜ್ಞಾನಿಗಳನ್ನೂ, ಸಾಹಿತಿಗಳನ್ನೂ ತರಬೇತು ಗೊಳಿಸಿತು. ಕನ್ನಡದ ಆಧುನಿಕೀಕರಣವನ್ನು ಸಾಧಿಸಿ ಅದನ್ನು ಕೊನೆಯ ಹಂತದವರೆಗೆ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣದ ಮಾಧ್ಯಮವನ್ನಾಗಿ ಮಾಡಿತು. ಇಂದಿನ ಭಾರತದ ಶ್ರೇಷ್ಠ ಕವಿಗಳಲ್ಲೊಬ್ಬರಾದ ಕುವೆಂಪುರವರು ಇಲ್ಲಿಯೇ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಯಾಗಿ ಬೆಳೆದು ಪ್ರಾಧ್ಯಾಪಕ-ಕುಲಪತಿಗಳಾಗಿ ಅಮೋಘ ಸೇವೆ ಸಲ್ಲಿಸಿದರು. ಕನ್ನಡ ನಾಡಿನಲ್ಲೆಲ್ಲ ಅವರ ಹೆಸರು ಮನೆಮಾತಾಗಿದೆ. ಅವರ ನೇತೃತ್ವದಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆದ ಕನ್ನಡ ಇಲಾಖೆಯೇ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಇಂದಿನ ಕುಲಪತಿಗಳಾದ ಪ್ರೊಫೆಸರ್‌ ಜವರೇಗೌಡರವರನ್ನು ಮೈಸೂರು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಒದಗಿಸಿಕೊಟ್ಟಿದೆ. ಅವರೂ ಖ್ಯಾತ ಸಾಹಿತಿಗಳು, ಕನ್ನಡದ ಜ್ಞಾನಕೋಶವನ್ನು ಜನತೆಗೆ ಒದಗಿ ಸುವದರಲ್ಲಿ ಅವರು ಪರಿಶ್ರಮವಹಿಸಿರುವದಲ್ಲದೆ, ಕನ್ನಡ ನಾಡಿನ ಎಲ್ಲ ಭಾಗಗಳ ಸಾಹಿತಿಗಳಿಗೆ ಅವರು ಪ್ರೋತ್ಸಾಹವನ್ನು ನೀಡಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಮೊನ್ನೆ ಮೊನ್ನೆ ಅವರು ರಷ್ಯಾ ದೇಶದ ಪ್ರವಾಸವನ್ನು ಕೈಕೊಂಡಾಗ, ಕೀವ್ ವಿಶ್ವ ವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಲೆನಿನ್ ಪಾರಿತೋಷಕವನ್ನು ಕೊಟ್ಟು ಸತ್ಕರಿಸಿ ಕನ್ನಡ ಜನತೆಯನ್ನು ಗೌರವಿಸಿತು. ಇದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ನಾನು ಅವರನ್ನು ಹೃತ್ ಪೂರ್ವಕವಾಗಿ ಅಭಿನಂದಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ.</p>
		<p>ಇಂತಹ ಸಂದರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ಘಟಿಕೋತ್ಸವದಲ್ಲಿ ಭಾಗವಹಿಸುವದೆಂದರೆ ಯಾವ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗನ ಮೈ ಪುಲಕಿತವಾಗಲಿಕ್ಕಿಲ್ಲ ?</p>
		<p>ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಜಾಪ್ರಭುತ್ವವು ಭದ್ರವಾಗಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಸಾಮಾ ಜಿಕ ವಿಕಾಸಕ್ಕೆ ತುಂಬ ಆಸ್ಪದ ಕೊಡಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಭಾರತೀಯರು ತಮ್ಮ ದೇಶದ ಸ್ವಾತಂತ್ರವನ್ನೂ , ಪ್ರಜಾಪ್ರಭುತ್ವವನ್ನೂ ಒಂದು ಅಮೂಲ್ಯ ಸಾಧನವನ್ನಾಗಿ ಉಪಯೋಗಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ತಮ್ಮ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರದ ಸಾಂಸತ್ತಿಕ ಸ್ಥಿತಿಯನ್ನು ಸುಧಾರಿಸುವದಲ್ಲದೆ, ಜನಸಾಮಾನ್ಯರ ಕಲ್ಯಾಣ ವನ್ನು ಸಾಧಿಸಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಆರ್ಥಿಕ ಸಂಪತ್ತಿನೊಡನೆ ಬೌದ್ದಿಕ ಸಂಪತ್ತನ್ನೂ, ಹೃದಯ ಸಂಪತ್ತನ್ನೂ ಸಂವರ್ಧಿಸಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಈ ಮಹತ್ ಕಾರ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊಸ ಪೀಳಿಗೆಯ ಹೊಸ ಉತ್ಸಾಹದ ತರುಣರು ವಹಿಸಬೇಕಾದ ಪಾತ್ರ ವಿಶಿಷ್ಟವಾಗಿದೆ. ಅದನ್ನು ಕುರಿತು ಒಂದೆರಡು ಮಾತನ್ನು ಹೇಳಲಿಚ್ಛಿಸುತೇನೆ. ﻿</p>
		<p>ಬೇರೊಂದು ಆರ್ಥಿಕ ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಬೆಳೆದ ನನ್ನ ತಲೆ ಮಾರಿನವರಿಗೆ ಹೊಸ ಪೀಳಿಗೆಯ ಆಶೋತ್ತರಗಳನ್ನು ಸರಿಯಾಗಿ ತಿಳಿದು ಕೊಳ್ಳುವದು ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಕಠಿಣವಾಗಿದೆ. ಕಳೆದ ತಿಂಗಳು, ಉತ್ತರ ಹಿಂದೂ ಸ್ವಾನದ ಪ್ರವಾಸವನ್ನು ಕೈಕೊಂಡ ಮೈಸೂರು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯದ ಕೆಲವು ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಪಂಜಾಬ ರಾಜಭವನಕ್ಕೂ ಬಂದು ನನ್ನನ್ನು ಕಂಡಿದ್ದರು. ಅಲ್ಲೋಪಹಾರದ ಸಂದರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾತುಕತೆ ನಡೆದಾಗ, “ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ರಾಜಕಾರಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಭಾಗವಹಿಸುವದನ್ನು ಕುರಿತು ತಮ್ಮ ಅಭಿಪ್ರಾಯವೇನು ? ” ಎಂದು ಅವರಲ್ಲೊಬ್ಬರು ನನ್ನನ್ನು ಕೇಳಿದರು. ಉತ್ತರ ಹಿಂದೂಸ್ತಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆದ ಸಂಗತಿಗಳು ನನ್ನ ಜ್ಞಾಪಕಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದವು. ಕಾಲೇಜಿನ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ ವಸತಿಗೃಹ ಇಲ್ಲವೆ ಜಮ್ಖಾನಾ ಚುನಾವಣೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ, ಅಥವಾ ಕಾಲೇಜ ಯೂನಿಯನ್ನಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಭಾಗವಹಿಸುವದನ್ನು ನೀವು ರಾಜ ಕಾರಣವೆಂದು ತಿಳಿಯುವದಾದರೆ ಅದರಲ್ಲಿ ಅನುಚಿತವಾದುದೇನೂ ಇಲ್ಲ ವೆಂದು ನಾನು ಹೇಳಿದೆ. ಆದರೆ ವಿಧಾನಸಭೆ ಇಲ್ಲವೆ ಲೋಕಸಭೆಯ ಚುನಾವಣೆಗೆ ಹುರಿಯಾಳಾಗಿ ನಿಲ್ಲುವದಾಗಲಿ, ಇಲ್ಲವೆ ತಮಗೆ ತಾತ್ಕಾಲಿಕ ಸಂಬಂಧವಿಲ್ಲದ ವ್ಯವಹಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿದೆಶೆಯಲ್ಲಿದ್ದಾಗಲೂ ಅಗ್ರ ಪಾತ್ರವಹಿಸುವದೆಂದರೆ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ತಮ್ಮ ಆಯುಷ್ಯವನ್ನು ಹಾಳು ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡಂತಾಗುವುದೆಂದು ನನ್ನ ಅಭಿಪ್ರಾಯವಾಗಿತ್ತು, ಅಭ್ಯಾಸದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಶ್ರದ್ಧೆ, ನಿಷ್ಠೆ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿರುವದೂ ಅತ್ಯಾವಶ್ಯಕ. ಇಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೆ ಅವರನ್ನು ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಜನೆಗಾಗಿ ಕಳಿಸಿದ ಹಿರಿಯರ ಹಣವನ್ನೂ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಹಾಳುಮಾಡಿದಂತಾಗುತ್ತದೆಂಬುದು ನನ್ನ ಖಂಡಿತ ಅಭಿಪ್ರಾಯವೆಂದೂ ಹೇಳಿದೆನು. ಆದರೆ ನನ್ನ ಅಭಿಪ್ರಾಯ ಆ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ ಮಿತ್ರರಿಗೆ ಎಷ್ಟರ ಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ರುಚಿಸಿತೋ ನನಗೆ ಗೊತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ. ಆದರೆ ಇದು ಎಲ್ಲರೂ ಕಲೆತು ವಿಚಾರಮಾಡುವ ವಿಷಯವಾಗಿದೆ. ವಿದ್ಯಾಸಂಪಾದನೆಯ ಅನಂತರ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಇಡಿ ಆಯುಷ್ಯವನ್ನೇ ರಾಜಕಾರಣದಲ್ಲಿ ತೊಡಗಿಸಬಹುದು. ಆದರೆ ಶಾರೀರಿಕ, ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಮತ್ತು ನೈತಿಕ ವಿಕಾಸದ ಕಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ ರಾಜಕಾರಣದ ಮೋಹ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳಿಗೇಕೆಂಬುದು ನನಗೆ ತಿಳಿಯುವಂತಿಲ್ಲ.</p>
		<p>ಜಗತ್ತಿನ ಎಲ್ಲ ಭಾಗಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊಸ ವಿಚಾರಗಳ ಗಾಳಿಯೊಂದು ಈಗ ಬೀಸುತ್ತಿದೆ. ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಏನೆಲ್ಲ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆ ಗಳನ್ನೂ ಇಂದು ಕೇಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಅವರ ವಿಚಾರಗಳನ್ನು ನಾವು ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಸಹಾನುಭೂತಿಯಿಂದ ಕೇಳಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು. ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರೀಯ ಹಿತ ಮೂಲಗಳಿಗೆ ಅವು ಪೋಷಕವಾಗಿದ್ದರೆ ಮತ್ತು ಅವರ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿತ್ವದ﻿ ಸಂವರ್ಧನೆಗೆ ಅನುಕೂಲವಾಗಿದ್ದರೆ, ಅವರ ಸೂಚನೆಗಳನ್ನು ಅವಶ್ಯವಾಗಿ ಸ್ವೀಕರಿಸಬೇಕು.</p>
		<p> ವಿದ್ಯಾಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಸಂಶೋಧನಾಲಯಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ನಡೆಯುವ ಕಾರ್ಯವಹತಿ, ಹಿಂದೆಂದೂ ಇಲ್ಲದಂತೆ, ಸಮಕಾಲೀನ ಜಗತ್ತಿನ ರೂಪ ರೇಷೆಗಳನ್ನು ಇಂದು ನಿಶ್ಚಿತಗೊಳಿಸುತ್ತಿದೆ. ಅಂತೆಯೇ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಉತ್ತಮ ಶಿಕ್ಷಕರೊಡನೆ ನಿಕಟ ಸಂಪರ್ಕವನ್ನಿಟ್ಟುಕೊಳ್ಳುವದು ಇಂದು ಅವಶ್ಯವಾಗಿದೆ. ಈ ರೀತಿ ಮಾತ್ರ ಒಂದು ಉತ್ತಮ ಸಾಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಕ ಸಂಪ್ರದಾಯವನ್ನು ನಾವು ಬೆಳೆಯಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ಬರಬಹುದು. ಈ ಸಂದರ್ಭದಲ್ಲಿ ರಷ್ಯಾ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾಡುವಂತೆ ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಸಹ ಪ್ರತಿಭಾವಂತ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳನ್ನಾರಿಸಿ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಸೇರುವ ವಿಶಿಷ್ಟ ತರಬೇತಿಯನ್ನು ಕೊಡುವದು ಈಗ ಉತ್ತಮ ವಿಧಾನವೆಂದು ನನಗೆ ತೋರುತ್ತಿದೆ. ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕುಲಪತಿಗಳು ಇದೀಗ ರಷ್ಯಾ ದೇಶದ ಪ್ರವಾಸ ವನ್ನು ಮುಗಿಸಿಕೊಂಡು ಬಂದಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಅಲ್ಲಿಯ ಮಾಸ್ಕೋ, ಲೆನಿನ್‌ಗ್ರಾಡ ಮುಂತಾದ ಮೇರಗತಿಯ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಗಳಲ್ಲಿ, ಎರಡು ವರ್ಷಗಳ ಪ್ರಿಯೂನಿವರ್ಸಿಟಿ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿಭಾವಂತ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳಿಗೋಸ್ಕರ ಏರ್ಪಡಿಸಿರುವದನ್ನು ಅವರು ನೋಡಿರಬಹುದು. ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಭೌತಶಾಸ್ತ್ರ ಮತ್ತು ಗಣಿತಶಾಸ್ತ್ರಗಳನ್ನು ಆಧುನಿಕ ರೀತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಲಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಮುಂದೆ ವಿಶ್ವ ವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯದಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಅವರವರು ಆಯ್ಕೆ ಮಾಡಿದ ವಿಷಯಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೇ ಅವರಿಗೆ ತರಬೇತಿ ಕೊಡಲಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ರಷ್ಯನ್ ಎಂಜಿನಿಯರ್‌ಗಳು ಹಾಗೂ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನಿಗಳು ಶ್ರೇಷ್ಠ ಮಟ್ಟವನ್ನು ಮುಟ್ಟಿರುವ ರಹಸ್ಯ ಇಲ್ಲಿದೆ. ನಮ್ಮ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ವೈಜ್ಞಾನಿಕ ವಿಷಯಗಳಲ್ಲದೆ, ಇನ್ನಿತರ ವಿಷಯಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಈ ಕ್ರಮವನ್ನು ನಾವು ಅನುಸರಿಸಬಹುದು. ಎಲ್ಲ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳನ್ನು ಒಂದೇ ಪಡಿಯಚ್ಚಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಹಾಕಿ ತೆಗೆಯುವದೆಂದರೆ ದೇಶಕ್ಕೆ ಅಪಾಯವಾಗು ತದೆ. ಇಂಥ ಉತ್ತಮ ಶ್ರೇಣಿಯ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಯೋಗ್ಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವನ್ನು ಪಡೆದು ಮುಂದೆ ಉತ್ತಮ ಪ್ರಾಧ್ಯಾಪಕ, ಸಂಶೋಧಕ ಇಲ್ಲವೆ ಆಡಳಿತ ಗಾರರಾಗಿ ದೇಶಸೇವೆಯನ್ನು ಸಲ್ಲಿಸಲಿಕ್ಕೆ ಸಮರ್ಥರಾಗುತ್ತಾರೆ. ರಷ್ಯ ದಂತಹ ಸಮತಾವಾದಿ ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಕೂಡ ಆಯ್ದ ಪ್ರತಿಭಾವಂತ ವಿದ್ಯಾ ರ್ಥಿಗಳಿಗೋಸ್ಕರವೆಂದೇ ವಿಶೇಷ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ತರಗತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಏರ್ಪಡಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಇಂತಹ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣಗಳನ್ನು ಮಾನವಿಕ ವಿಷಯಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಏರ್ಪಡಿಸಿದರೆ ಮೈಸೂರು ರಾಜ್ಯದ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಐ. ಎ. ಎಸ್., ಐ. ಪಿ ಎಸ್. ಮುಂತಾದ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಪ್ರಮಾಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಉತ್ತೀರ್ಣರಾಗಬಹುದು. ಈ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಬೇಕಾದ ಮುಖ್ಯ ವಿಷಯಗಳು ಇಂಗ್ಲಿಷ್, ಇತಿಹಾಸ,﻿ ಅರ್ಥಶಾಸ್ತ್ರ, ರಾಜನೀತಿ ಮುಂತಾದವುಗಳು. .ಮೈಸೂರು ರಾಜ್ಯದ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಈ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾಕಷ್ಟು ಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಉತ್ತೀರ್ಣ ರಾಗುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ. ಎಲ್ಲ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳಿಗೂ ಈ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಗಳ ಮಹತ್ವ ತಿಳಿಯುವಂತೆ ಮೈಸೂರು ರಾಜ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿಯ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಗಳು ಪ್ರಯತ್ನಿ ಸಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಅಲ್ಲದೆ ಇಂಗ್ಲಿಷ್, ರಷ್ಯನ್ ಮೊದಲಾದ ಪರಭಾಷೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಪರಿಣತ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಹೆಚ್ಚಾಗಿ ದೊರೆಯುವಂತೆ ಶ್ರಮಿಸಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಒಂದು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯದ ಸ್ಥಾನಮಾನ ಅದರ ಇಲಾಖೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆಯುವ ಸಂಶೋಧನ ಕಾರ್ಯ ದಿಂದಲೂ, ಹಾಗೂ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರೀಯ ಮಟ್ಟದ ಪರೀಕ್ಷೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳು ಪಡೆಯುವ ಯಶಸ್ಸಿನಿಂದಲೂ ನಿರ್ಣಯಿತವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY S.S. RAY<br />on Sunday, 16th Jan. 1972 MR. CHANCELLOR, MR. VICE-CHANCELLOR, LADIES AND<br />GENTLEMEN AND GRADUATES OF THE YEAR :</h1>
		<p><span class="bigletter">A</span> t the outset, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to the authorities of the University of Mysore for inviting me here today to deliver the convocation address. I am very glad to have the opportunity of being here amidst the graduates and the distinguished academicians of the University of Mysore which, for over fifty years, has rendered signal service to the cause of higher education. I hope that in the years to come, it will be given to the University of Mysore to face with increasing success, the problemis and challenges of changing India and to demonstrate by example how education can instil in its recipients a true sense of the values which will help them to build a new society. We have in our country, through the days of the distant past built up value systems which in no way are irreconcilable with the science and technology of the present day. The key to the <em>rapprochement</em> between inherited values and modern science is education, which can impart on the one hand the essence of our tradition and through it, on the other, provide the recipient with the power to utilise for general social good the advantages of science and technology. The spiritual and literary history of Mysore offers a fit background against which this <em>rapprochement</em> can be achieved. The soil of Karnataka has repeatedly in the course of its history, shown itself capable of harmonising the old with the new. It has within its compass captured and represented the genius for synthesis which has characterised Indian philosophic thought and﻿ tradition through the ages. It was on this soil that different systems of philosophy converged and divergent strands of thought were inter-related and unified into a conceptual whole. It is on this soil again that we see functioning today one of the leading Indian Institutes of Science.' A more ideal background for adventurous thinking and for grappling with the perplexing problems which education poses today would be hard to find.</p>
		<p>Our preoccupations with such problems were recently interrupted, as you are all aware, by a grave national crisis caused by aggression on our borders, threatening the very security of our country. As a result of the gallant performance of our fighting forces on the battlefields and the single-minded resolve of the nation to defend the safety and integrity of our land, we care through the ordeal successfully and with a supreme manifestation of our moral force and material valour, we were able once again to hoist the flag of freedom. The unity and solidarity which the entire country displayed during its hour of peril represented the values for which this country stands and qur institutions of higher learning can contribute a great deal to ensure that this spirit is kept alive in times of peace as well. It is the least that we could do by way of homage to our valiant armed forces, as it is for the preservation of these very alues that they have so heroically fought in the theatres of war. The united resolve of our people and the spirit of determined action which were in such abundant evidence during our hour of trial should hearten us all and make us aware of our potential. It is this approach that should﻿ underlie our attempts towards national reconstruction which includes the restructuring of education.</p>
		<p>There is no doubt that much outstanding work has been done by universities like yours, our Institutes of Technology and other seats of higher learning, particularly in the realm of post-graduate education and research and it is everyone's wish that this should continue in an ever-increasing measure and that the highest standards should be aimed at and achieved. But it is inevitable that from time to time changes should take place to keep pace with current developments and to recognise the new facets of old problems. One of the many differences between the past and the present is the altered relationship between the teacher and the taught. This altered relationship has been accentuated by the present day explosion of knowledge and the early obsolescence of this knowledge and its swift replacement by more up-to-date knowledge, all of which has all but obliterated the distinction between the teacher and the student, as it obtained in an earlier day. Such a situation calls for modified approaches in the technique of teaching and the evaluation of the students' work. Translated into material terms, this would mean a new type of teacher education and reforms in the pattern of examination. There is also a need for standardisation in the quality of education imparted by various universities. Where universities were few, diverse approaches and standards led to variety which was desirable, whereas with the large number of universities mushrooming today, there is need for standardisation in order to ensure the quality of education imparted. This does not﻿ mean mere uniformity, but a level of effort which will help to preserve the essentials of learning and ensure the goals of higher education. The role of the institutions of higher education should always be to maintain high standards and to make sure that their graduates would actually benefit by what they have learnt during their study in their portals.</p>
		<p>This task is of such magnitude that it is time that we paused to consider whether we should not relieve our universities and other institutions of higher education of the responsibilities arising from the rest of the problems relating to higher education, problems which are not their direct concern. To saddle the universities with such additional responsibilities is to hamper their efforts in their specific areas of work. It is time we thought of establishing a separate machinery to handle these problems.</p>
		<p>What I have in mind is collegiate education which has to fulfil the demands of an increasing number of pupils drawn from all classes and strata, of society for such education. Without a doubt, we should provide equality of access to all types of education including education at the highest level for anyone who has the aptitude for it and has the desire to pursue it. But let us consider the kind of collegiate education to which we are giving them access. Is it a meaningful opportunity or is it just driving the increasing number of aspirants into a purposeless pursuit of a robot-like routine ending with the award of a degree? The principle of equality of opportunity is by no means carried out by the mass scale conferment of degrees. It is carried out only when it implies the﻿ opportunity for the attainment of quality in one's educational endeavour. This calls for a restructuring of our education at all levels. We have to introduce a pattern of education which suits the actual requirements of the individual and the society. We should put into operation a process of manpower planning and organise such educational programmes as will support this planning and provide the necessary manpower. Vocationalisation of education at the secondary level has to be more energetically pursued than at present and insistence on the part of employers on the possession of a degree as a pre-condition to any type of employment must be done away with. Such measures will pave the way for job-oriented education.</p>
		<p>The question of costs naturally arises and in this connection a point has been advanced whether it is necessary for the Government to subsidise university education for everyone. It is a pertinent point in a welfare State where the leisured classes can afford to pay for their liberal and general education which would meet their aesthetic and social needs. In such a situation, Government subsidies should be earmarked for those who cannot afford to pay their way although they are eminently fitted and equipped to receive the benefits of higher education. In an egalitarian society, pledged to ensure social justice, we have to go further by detecting talent among the financially ill-favoured from the school level onwards and granting them scholarships on a liberal scale in order to enable them to reach the highest peaks of educational excellence.</p>
		<p>It is not as if these questions have not received﻿ any thought or consideration in our country. Several Committees and Commissions have gone into them and made recommendations and published their reports. The Government and the University Grants Commission are also keenly aware of the problems which perplex us and had an investigation carried out last year under the chairmanship of Dr. Gajendragadkar on the subject. What is now required is the will and the determination among all those concerned with the administration of higher education to implement with expedition and despatch at least some of the reforms which are indicated.</p>
		<p>The avidity and enthusiasm we have displayed through the years in reflecting on our educational situation and analysing it from all angles and suggesting passible solutions, certainly wholesome as it is, should now be transferred in full measure to the realm ' of action. We have just recently proved to the world that we are not a nation which merely beats the air. In the most vital sphere of our national life, the defence of our country against external aggression, we have shown our mettle and demonstrated that we are capable of resolute action in a just cause. Let us then at this moment resolve to bend our energies to action in all those fields where such action is required and in the process transform our educational scene. Institutions of higher learning and all those engaged in educational reform, practising teachers, research workers and educational administrators can strive to make the educational process meaningful and purposive. This should lead to the creation of a background which will facilitate the involvement and﻿ participation of the student community in all aspects of institutional life. It should make them feel that it is a joy to be an integral part of the growth and progress of these institutions. The personal example of the teachers can draw the students in a stimulating partnership with them and the sense of purpose and fulfilment that this will generate will stem the incursion of politics into our seats of learning, a feature which all right-thinking men abhor. When the educational community knows clearly what it is about and what colleges and universities stand for, and are deeply involved in their academic pre-occupations, it should be impossible for political elements from any quarter, which seek to sow the seeds of disaffection, to make any headway. This would leave the student community free to partake of the fruits of academic life and develop a sense of responsibility. There will then be the chance for them to discern that to be young is not to be all-knowing, but a passing phase in which maturity is to be gained.</p>
		<p>If higher education is to develop along these lines in India, it is essential that the various States and the Centre should work together to implement the measures suggested by various Committees and Commissions. Naturally, the first step is for each institution to reform itself, not forgetting in the process that it is one amongst the many institutions of higher learning. In order to serve the educational needs of the country effectively, all the institutions, while pursuing their individual destinies, should together form a national pattern, eliminating waste.</p>
		<p>Finally, I wish to congratulate all the graduates assembled here on the successful completion of their studies and wish them all possible opportunities for further self-development and service to the country. I would plead with them that they should enter upon their next stage of life with confidence in themselves and faith in the country whose tasks and challenges will soon devolve on them with the assurance that the country will not fail them.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY S. NURUL HASAN on Saturday, 13th Jan.<br />Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Pro-Chancellor,<br />Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Distinguished Guests and Graduates of the year,</h1>
		<p>I am grateful to the authorities of the Mysore University and especially to its Vice-Chancellor, Professor Javare Gowda, for having invited me to participate in this function. I deem it a privilege and an honour to do so, specially when I think of the distinguished men who, in the past, have addressed your convocations. I have, therefore, accepted this invitation in a spirit of humility and especially because it is always a stimulating and pleasant experience for me to be in the midst of students and teachers engaged in the pursuit of knowledge and excellence and all that it implies.</p>
		<p>I have always been keenly interested in the development of this University. It has symbolised the aspirations of the people of Mysore to make their contribution to the promotion of learning and enlightenment. Several distinguished ViceChancellors have guided its affairs among whom I might specially refer to my predecessor in office Dr. K. L. Shrimali. The efforts of a distinguished band of teachers and students have also materially helped in making the University what it now is. I am also happy that the Uni vetsity is now presided over by Professor Javare Gowda who is an eminent scholar and a great﻿ educationist. I am sure that under his far-sighted leadership the University will rise to further heights.</p>
		<p>To the young men and women who have been awarded degrees and distinctions today, I offer my warm felicitations. I wish them a happy New Year and a prosperous and fruitful life. The hallmark of higher education is a liberal mind which abhors all narrow parochial trends; and it is only the liberal minds developed in higher education that can help to create the secular, democratic and socialist society which is our national objective. I, therefore, look upon the young men and women who come out of our university system to wage a relentless war against the retrograde forces of chauvinism, regionalism, casteism or linguism which are now raising their ugly heads in several parts of the country and threatening our national unity, strength and progress. I am sure that the graduates of this University will play their proper role in this war against these retrograde forces, side by side with the graduates of ather universities, and prove themselves worthy of this great institution.</p>
		<p class="text-center">II</p>
		<p>There is universal agreement on the important role which higher education plays in national development. It is the one major instrument through which a nation continually strives to preserve, disseminate and extend knowledge, to train the high level manpower needed for leadership in all walks of life, to understand the problems of existence in all their complexity and to devise appropriate solutions for them, and generally, to help the people to improve the quality of their life in all its aspects. It is also a major instrument of social transformation and developing countries like ours have to rely heavily on education to create the new society of our dreams. Faith in the universities or higher education is, therefore, merely an expression of our faith in the future of our country. Perhaps the best expression of this faith can be found in the noble words of Jawaharlal Nehru who, addressing a Convocation of my Alma Mater, the University of Allahabad, said: "A University stands for humanism, for tolerance, for reason, for the adventure of ideas and for the search of truth. It stands for the onward march of the human race towards even higher objectives. If the universities discharge their duties adequately, then, it is well with the nation and the people".</p>
		<p>What is causing serious anxiety to all of us at the present moment is the fact that, for a complexity and a variety of reasons, the universities are not in a position to discharge their duties adequately. Some of the difficulties are internal to the system (i.e., outmoded curricula, nonproduction of high quality teaching and learning materials, or inappropriate methods of teaching and evaluation) and a determined effort on the part of the teachers and students can overcome them. But several other difficulties are outside﻿ the system. These, for instance, include inadequacy of resources, non-availability of adequate employment opportunities and the disastrous results of unhealthy political and other pressures exerted upon the system. These cannot be solved unless the society as a whole, and its leadership of all categories, recognise the significance of higher education to national development, learn to exercise restraint and create that atmosphere and those necessary conditions which alone can help a university system to function satisfactorily: I am, therefore, convinced that the present serious crisis in our system of higher education can only be resolved if all of us - Government, political parties, leaders of all walks of social life, teachers and students-join hands together and make a wellplanned and concerted effort to improve higher education. This alone will enable the universities to function satisfactorily and thereby, in the words of Jawaharlal Nehru I have just quoted, lead to the progress of the people and the nation.</p>
		<p class="text-center">III</p>
		<p>It is obviously not possible, in the short time at my disposal today, to deal with all the major problems of higher education which we will have to make a concerted effort to solve in the next few years. I shall, however, deal, in some detail, with one of them, namely, the problem of numbers.</p>
		<p>One of the outstanding features of our system of higher education which began a little more than﻿ a century ago, is the tremendous expansion it has achieved. In 1857, when the Universities of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras were established, there were only 27 colleges of all types, and in the first Matriculation Examinations conducted by these universities, only 219 students passed. By 1947, universities increased to 19, the colleges to 636 and their enrolments to 256,000. Great as this expansion was, it has been far surpassed in the last 25 years. We now have about a hundred institutions of university status, about 3,600 colleges of all types and an enrolment of over 30 lakhs. What is even more staggering is the indiction that, at the present rate of expansion, we will have about 5,000 colleges and nearly 60 lakhs students in higher education by the end of the current decade.</p>
		<p>This expansion of higher education has both positive and negative aspects. It has certainly had several beneficial results. In the pre-independence period, it awakened national consciousness and strengthened the struggle for freedom. In the post-independence period, it has given us the political leadership to run the world's largest democracy and the scientific and technical leadership to modernize our industry, and to create a green revolution in agriculture. All along these years, it has enabled the less privileged social groups to throw up a new leadership and by accelerating social mobility, has strengthened egalitarian trends. On the other hand, it has also led to the dilution of standards in a majority of﻿ institutions of higher education and created a large and growing group of the educated unemployed, who threaten to disorganise national life. It is, therefore, necessary for us to understand the different dimensions of this problem in their complexity and to take appropriate measures for their solution.</p>
		<p>Let me first of all make it clear that even with this expansion, I cannot regard India as an over-educated country. If our national goals are to be realised and the right to education enshrined in the Constitution has to become a reality, we need, not less, but much more of higher education. Unfortunately, our policies in this field are subject to three major constraints. The first is the shortage of good quality teachers who alone can enable us to maintain adequate standards. The second is the lack of financial resources which prevents us from expanding full-time institutions of higher education beyond a certain optimum number. It also limits the total amount of subsidy we can provide for higher education; we may give a small subsidy to a large number of students or a larger subsidy to a small number of students. But we do not just have the resources to give a large subsidy to an unlimited number of students. The third major constraint is that of the comparatively limited employment opportunities that are being thrown up by the rate at which the economy is expanding at present. Even with the best that we can hope to do in this field, the economy may not grow at more than 6 or 7 per cent﻿ per annum while the output of graduates is increasing at 11 to 13 percent per annum. It is therefore not possible for the economy to absorb the output of this system of higher education whose relationship to productivity is rather tenuous. It therefore becomes obvious that, in spite of all theoretical argument to the contrary, we will have to regulate the expansion of the system of higher education within manageable proportions and relate it more realistically to the manpower needs of economy and social development or the employment opportunities that are being generated from time to time.</p>

		<p>How is this regulation of the expansion of higher education to be attempted in practice. This is one of the most important questions to which we have to address ourselves. Obviously, a complex situation. We shall therefore have to develop several programmes for this purpose.</p>
		<p>My first suggestion is that a major remedy for this problem lies, not in higher education itself, but in secondary education which has three major defects. It is generally a single continuous stage. Under such a system, a student enters it at so young an age that any kind of direct or indirect selective procedure is ruled out; and once in, he has no option but to continue to the end. Its duration is too short so that a student who completes the secondary school is generally about 16 or 17 and therefore not eligible for appointment nor mature﻿ enough to profit adequately by university studies. What is even worse, it has an undiversified and non-vocationalized character so that, instead of preparing a majority of students for different walks of life, it fits the average student for entrance to a college and almost unfits him for everything else. It is because of all these major weaknesses of the system of secondary education that a secondary school leaver finds himself unwanted everywhere, and it is they which compel him to make education, not a preparation for work, but a substitute for it and to seek asylum in a college. An engineer who is concerned with serious floods in the plains takes the first step in its defence by putting up dams, not in the plains, but higher up in tne mountain regions where the floods originate. Similarly, we must try to control the flood of numbers in higher education by putting appropriate dams at the stage of secondary education itself. We must first lengthen the duration of secondary education in such a way. that the entire period of school education covers 12 years and a secondary school graduate is about 18 years of age and mature enough for employment or entrance to a university course of studies. Further, we will have to put a break in the school system at the end of Class X or about the age of 16 when a student would be sufficiently grown up to make an intelligent decision about his future career. Thirdly, we will have to diversify and vocationalize the higher secondary stage so that secondary education becomes terminal 'for a﻿ majority of students and prepares them for different and useful careers in life. This is why the Radhakrishnan Commission and the Kothari Commission recommended the adoption of the 10+2+3 pattern. This programme deserves, to be given high priority in the Fifth Five Year Plan.</p>
		<p>Another suggestion which I would like to make in this context relates to the modification of the existing recruitment and wage policies. At present, all worthwhile jobs have become willynilly the preserve of persons who have received higher education and the differential of wages between those who have received secondary and higher education is so large that private investment in higher education becomes very profitable even from the economic point of view, not to say anything of its social and cultural advantages. A deliberate attempt will have to be made to turn the tables. It has been suggested that recruitment to all services in the public sector should be at the end of the school stage of 12 years, and that the persons selected should be given such further education as is necessary for them at State expense, through a liberal programme of scholarships. The army chooses its personnel at the end of the secondary stage and with good results. The engineering and medical professions also do the same with equally good results. There is no reason why the same principle should not be extended to all other public services. I would, therefore, suggest that this pro﻿blem which can only be tackled on a national basis by a co-ordinated effort of the Central and State Governments, should receive our earnest consideration. Obviously, so radical a reform of the recruitment policies will have to be followed up with several others which will radically alter the promotional policies, inter-service transfers and 1 several other allied issues. But all this will be extremely worthwhile; and once the appropriate decisions can be taken, we will be able to reduce the rush of students to universities who generally go there in the vain hope of being able to net a good job in the public sector.</p>
		<p class="text-center">V</p>
		<p>In the university stage itself, I would like to emphasise that we must make every effort to see that proper standards are maintained and that what we call 'higher education' does effectively indicate its contents as the label on a bottle of standard medicine. When I use the expression 'maintenance of standards', I do mean, not only the intellect, but a good deal besides. I do feel very strongly that standards in higher education must imply liberalizing of the mind to rise above narrow panochial considerations, developments of a rational and scientific temper, inculcation of basic human values, strengthening of national integration, awakening a sense of social responsibility and social awareness and building up of habits of self-study and promoting problem-solving﻿ ability. If these standards are to be maintained, we will have to plan the location of colleges very carefully, ensure that every institution of higher education will have a faculty and enrolment of a critical size and the necessary facilities and teachers of the right quality.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, al good deal of expansion that is now taking place in higher education is at the cost of, quality. The location of colleges is unplanned and haphazard; most of the new colleges to be established are small, uneconomic and nonviable academic units; even the minimum facilities required are often not provided and the qualifications prescribed for teachers are often diluted. These are the wrong methods of expansion and they do more harm than good. We must now adopt a new policy under which we will try to achieve the maximum expansion possible in a planned manner and consistently with the maintenance of standards. Perhaps a major restraint in the present situation is the limited number of competent teachers available and the lack of monetary and material resources. If due heed is paid to this restraint and standards in higher education are not allowed to fall below the minimum prescribed, there would be an automatic limitation on the number of institutions which will be providing full-time instruction and their enrolments. This is a limitation which we must willingly accept because it can be ignored only at great national peril.</p>
		<p>As the uncontrolled expansion at the univer﻿sity stage takes place mostly through private colleges, it has also been suggested tha our policy towards private enterprise should be reviewed. At present, the initiative for opening new institutions is mostly left to private enterprise, and once it starts new colleges in any implanned or haphazard manner, the State is called upon, sooner rather than later, to assist it with subsidy from the public exchequer. It has therefore been suggested that the State should now come forward and take initiative in establishing new colleges and that these should be established only in under-developed areas or for the under-privileged sections of the community, for both of which private enterprise does not generally cater. Some have also suggested that no grant-in-aid should be given to any private college established after 1st April, 1974, when the Fifth Five Year Plan will begin. Others have suggested that no private college should be allowed to be established in the Fifth Five Year Plan unless it is able to bear a fairly substantial portion of its total cost, thereby reducing the subsidy from the public exchequer. I have not taken a view on this as yet. But I do feel that these suggestions need to be seriously examined by all concerned. What is equally important, measures which deny or reduce subsidies from public exchequer to new institutions of higher education will have to be extended over the years; in a planned and a phased manner, even to existing instituttons as well.﻿</p>
		<p>The two measures indicated above, in whatever form they are adopted, will certainly lead to some regulation of the expansion of facilities for full-time higher education. One result of this restriction may be that the weaker and poorer sections of the community get squeezed out of full-time institutions which may come to be monopolized, almost exclusively, by the better off sections of the community. This would indeed be a calamity; and if this result' were inevitable, I would even prefer the present policy of open door access in spite of all its weaknesses. But fortunately, this is not so. In spite of the overall contraction in the size of full-time enrolments in higher education, it is still possible to increase the access of the weaker sections of the community to higher education. This can be secured, as I have stated earlier, by establishing Government institutions in under-developed areas or for the benefit of under-privileged social groups. In addition, steps may be taken to reserve, in all institutions of higher education providing fulltime instruction, an adequate number of seats for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections of the community defined on the basis of appropriate socio-economic criteria. Moreover, fee grants, hostels and scholarships should also be made available to students coming from under-privileged social groups on a liberal scale so that their interests are not adversely affected by the restrictions on the opening of new institutions and the denial (or reduction) of subsidy to new institutions.﻿</p>
		<p>I would also like to compensate the limitations placed on the expansion of full-time instruction, to some extent, by increasing informal types of higher education so that it becomes available to all who seek it and qualify themselves for it. From this point of view, I would recommend a large expansion of programmes of part-time education, correspondence courses, or self-study. I would prefer to have one National Open University having jurisdiction over the entire country so that any student, even in the remotest corner of the country, can have access to its instruction and degrees, if he so desires, at a minimal cost which would be within his reach and without affecting his capacity to earn and help himself and his family. This should be supplemented by the development of a programme of correspondence courses in at least one university in every State. In addition, private study should receive the most liberal emphasis and it should be open to' all' individuals to appear at all Board and University examinations as private candidates. All colleges should function as academic centres and throw open their facilities to students studying on a part-time or self-study basis, and such academic centres could even be established in good secondary schools.</p>
		<p class="text-center">VI </p>
		<p>To sum up, I visualize, over the few years, a programme of regulating the expansion of higher education, in a planned manner so that﻿ the products of the university system can be quickly absorbed in the economy. This will need a major effort of reform at the secondary stage to increase its duration, to adopt the 10+2+3 pattern and to vocationalize the higher secondary stage. It will also imply reduction of wage differentials that now operate between the secondary and college graduates and a radical re-orientation of the recruitment policies in the public sector to select all the persons required at the end of the secondary stage. Coming to the university stage itself, this will imply a limitation on the number of places available in institutions providing fulltime instruction, mainly on account of lack of resources and the necessity of maintaining adequate standards. It will also imply a change of policy towards the priyate sector and assumption of a larger initiative by the State in the establishment of new institutions. In order that these measures should not adversely affect the interests of the under-developed or under-privileged sections of the community, it will be necessary to reserve seats for them in institutions for fulltime instruction and to provide scholarships and fee grants on a liberal scale. Above all, programmes of part-time education or self-study will have to be greatly expanded to ensure that higher education is available to all who seek it and qualify themselves for it. I do believe that a satisfactory programme for the development of higher education in the Fifth Five Year Plan can be developed on these broad principles. This is a task to which the universities and State Governments have now to address themselves.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY Dr. GEORGE JACOB on Sunday, 20th Jan. 1974<br />MR. CHANCELLOR, MR. PRO-CHANCELLOR, MR. VICE<br />CHANCELLOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND GRADUATES OF THE YEAR:</h1>
		<p>I am very happy to be with you today to participate in the Amual Convocation of your University and to address the graduates who are passing out this year. Mysore University is the sixth oldest University in this country and, next to Banaras Hindu University, is the oldest university established in India during the 20th century. Under the old dispensation when we had a British India and Indian States, Mysore University was the first university to be established in an Indian State. So this university can legitimately look back with pride and satisfaction to the long period of useful and creative work that it has rendered. But today, university education in this country is at the cross-roads. Questions are being asked in many quarters whether universities are serving the purpose for which they were set up. This question needs consideration, first, by teachers in colleges and universities, and next, by those who administer colleges and universities.</p>
		<p>The Central Advisory Board of Education has recommended an educational system of 10 years of school followed by 2 years of post-high school training followed by a 3-year degree course (10+2+3). The University Grants Commission﻿ will be considering this at the next meeting of the Advisory Committee of Vice-Chancellors. The UGC and Universities are concerned with the last part of this scheme, namely 3 years for a degree course. Personally I endorse the 3 year degree course because I am of the view that to do any subject in depth and certain allied subjects also in sufficient depth, a period of 3 years is necessary. But the 12 years of training preceding this 3-year degree course is not primarily the concern of universities or the University Grants Commission. It is the concern of the secondary school or the higher secondary school system of education. But colleges and universities cannot afford to ignore what happens in schools and in higher secondary classes, because what can be done during the 3 years in the degree classes depends on the academic level of the students who are admitted to the first year of the degree class. Even today Delhi University admits to the degree classes students who have passed the Delhi Higher Secondary Examination, which is held after a course of 11 years. So the Delhi graduate who does a 3-year degree course actually puts in only 14 years, viz., 11 #-3. Yet the Delhi graduate compares very favourably with graduates of other universities in the country. This is because the Higher Secondary Examination of Delhi represents a high level of attainment. With one more year added to these eleven years of schooling, the Higher Secondary examination of Delhi can be raised to a still higher level of academic attainment. The standard of proficiency of a﻿ student admitted to the first year of a degree course will determine, to a large extent, what a college or university will be able to do during the 3 years of the degree course. I am emphasising this because universities and colleges do not generally concern themselves with the standard achieved by boys and girls at the secondary school stage. The leadership of the university should help secondary schools and high schools to step up their standards in the different subjects.</p>
		<p>Of all the subjects taught at the school stage, the basic ones, having a vital connection with the standard to be achieved in university courses are the languages-English and Kannada for this region-and Mathematics. Take the example of the study of English as a language. What we have to attempt is to ensure that the student has a certain vocabulary of the English language at his command when he comes to the first year of the degree course. Anyone, who falls very much below this requirement of vocabulary, will not be able to cope with the work in a university or college if the medium of instruction is English. In the same way, in Mathematics it should be possible to measure the standard of achievement of a student by the time he finishes the secondary school. The degree courses should be built on this foundation of a sound standard of attainment on the part of the student who comes to the first year class.</p>
		<p>This University uses both English and Kannada as the medium of instruction at the degree level in Arts, Science and Commerce, but at the postgraduate level it has only one medium of instruction, viz., English for all the three faculties. How do we ensure that students who have taken a B.A., B.Sc. or B.Com. degree with Kannada medium have sufficient proficiency in the English languge to be able to cope with the requirements of a post-graduate course in Arts, Science, or Commerce? The same principle should be applied to the transition from the school to the university. On academic grounds, for a considerably long time, students and teachers of Indian Universities will have to be proficient in two languages-English and the mother tongue. For national integration, facility in a third language, Hindi, is also needed. In the case of your university, students and teachers should have a very high degree of competence in Kannada and English. Sixty per cent of the world's scientific knowledge comes out through journals in English. So any student who wants to do advanced work in a science subject must have sufficient command of the English language to be able to refer to up-to-date journals. But at the same time, he has to communicate his knowledge to other people in his own language. As a matter of fact, a scholar who has mastered the latest discoveries through the English language will become more creative as he tries to communicate that knowledge through his own mother-tongue.</p>
		<p>A second important question which concerns universities today is whether the syllabus followed in different fields is in the first place, up-to-date,﻿ and secondly whether it is related to the needs of the society around. The present pattern of a university prescribing a syllabus on the basis of which instruction is imparted to students in colleges has its serious limitations. The syllabus tends to get out-dated and the syllabus may not be related to the competence and experience of a teacher who teaches the subject. If, on the other hand, the prescribing of a syllabus becomes the responsibility of the teachers who will teach the subject and examine the students, there will be a vital correlation among prescribing the syllabus, teaching of the syllabus, and examining of the students. It is this concept which has been highlighted in the granting of autonomy to first-rate and reliable colleges in all the universities in this country. An autonomous college gets autonomy only in respect of its academic programmes. The teachers of the departments, assisted by a few outside experts, will prescribe the syllabus for a such a college. Teachers will teach the subject and will examine their own students. This will be a challenge to teachers because the teacher will have to maintain a standard of integrity and reliability which will not be questioned by his students.</p>
		<p>This standard of integrity and reliability in our teachers is basic to any improvement in our higher education</p>
		<p>As the University Education Commission Report (1948–49) says, "Moral and religious instruction does not mean moral improvement. What can﻿ be tested in an examination is acquaintance with theories. What we need is not the imparting of instruction, but the transmitting of vitality. We must civilise the human heart. Education of the emotions and discipline of the will are essential parts of a sound system of education”. Since instructing the intellect does not mean improving the heart, though thought has its own effects on life, how shall we build these values into the human mind ? If institutions are to impart moral vitality, they should have, as the University Education Commission Report (1948-49) further says, "simplicity and an atmosphere of consecration that permanently lives”. The greatest persuasion is exercised by personal examples. The personal examples of a team of dedicated and devoted teachers, carrying out their daily tasks, faithfully and earnestly, will have a great impact on their students and, in the ultimate analysis, will have a cleansing, and spiritualising effect on the college or department concerned. It is on the multiplicity of such teachers that the re-generation of our university education depends. As I said earlier, the concept of an autonomous college, with internal assessment by the teaching staff, will not be successful unless the autonomous college has a team of devoted and dedicated teachers of the highest integrity and reliability. So, integrity and reliability become essential requirements of a teacher in such an institution. Our university education has got into difficulty because these essential traits have been ignored, and we thought intellectual achieve﻿ment, without any moral commitment, could make a great teacher. A great teacher cannot be made that way. A great teacher must have intellectual competence of a very high order but, equally, he must have moral commitment and unimpeachable integrity.</p>
		<p>In the case of Agricuitural Universities in India, it has been observed that the employment market favours the products of innovative instiutions with high standards of education. A college, with competent and dedicated teachers, if granted autonomy, will become an innovative institution, whose products will be in demand in the employment market.</p>
		<p>Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, while addressing the graduates of Allahabad University in 1947, told them that universities in India stood for reason, humanism, tolerance, search for truth and adventure of ideas. And, he added, if our universities discharged their functions properly, all would be well with our country. In these two sentences Jawaharlal Nehru gave a brief, but, eloquent philosophy of education and the role of universities in Modern India. It is to enable our universities to discharge their functions effectively that the State recognises the autonomy of universities. The concept of autonomy implies, that there is discussion and even dissent. The junior teachers of a department should have the right to discuss and differ from the senior teachers of the same department. The student should have the right to discuss and, if necessary, differ﻿ from his teacher. But all discussion should be based on reason, humanism and tolerance, and with only one end in view, namely the search of truth. It is in this spirit of discussion and dissent that the university or the college becomes a centre of continuous growth.</p>
		<p>An authoritarian system is not conducive to intellectual development. It does not help the development of the subordinate who cultivates an attitude of subordination, but, equally, it does not help the development of the person in authority because he can take decisions without a debate or discussion. The weakness of the authoritarian system is that it kills initiative amongst the vast majority of participants. The university system is particularly efficient in bringing together people specialised in many fields who are but able to judge the work of their peers. Actually in the university system, the evaluation is always by one's peers and not by one's superiors. In the academic council of a university, the distinguished scholars of one faculty can make a distinct contribution to the betterment of the course of studies pursued in another faculty. The great strength of the University Grants Commission is also based on this concept of evaluation by peers. Whenever an institution or'a department is to be evaluated, the University Grants Commission gets the services of scholars, from other institutions, who have specialised in these fields. So, these scholars go to these departments not as inspectors, but as peers, and in﻿ consultation with those who are working in the department, the work of the department is assessed This is the most creative way in which knowledge grows and new ideas get adopted. If a university. can bring into practice this basic advantage of the university system, and if its faculty can go out into the neighbourhood, tackle problems relating to the neighbourhood and take to the people of the area this attitude of assistance by one's peers, they will be able to do what is best for the community around as a joint enterprise. This is the best way to evolve a social system in which an individual citizen will realise his significance and consequently will have a significant part to play in the development of his country. It is important for us to remember that though there are national problems, there are no national solutions, and each area has to choose a programme and to find a solution most suited to its environment and needs. It is this involvement in the problems of the area around that has made our outstanding agricultural universities, leaders in the fieid of agriculture and animal husbandry in those regions. The general universities have not been able to have such an impact because of their lack of involvement in the problems of the area.</p>
		<p>The development activities of the comprehensive area development programmes can be utilised to enable both teachers and students to bring their knowledge as well as devotion to the service of the people of the community. Earlier in this address, I expressed the view that autonomous colleges and﻿ departments will have the freedom to launch out into fields of innovation. I hope that by this means the syllabus will get updated in many colleges and departments and new means of communicating knowledge and assessing the same will be devised.</p>
		<p>Our democratic institutions have survived, but if they have to continue to survive, we have to breathe a new life into them. Our universities have so far stumbled along. If they are to be dynamic centres of light and learning, we have to breathe a new life into them. To that challenging duty I call teachers and students of this University.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY DR. RAJA RAMANNA on Saturday, 21st Dec. 1974<br />Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Pro-Chancellor, Mr. ViceChancellor, Members of the Senate, <br />Ladies and Gentlemen:<br /></h1>
		<p>I am deeply honoured that I have been invited to address you on the occasion of the Convocation of this great University. As you may know, this University conferred on me the distinction of the degree of Doctor of Science at the last convocation, an honour I cherish more than any other I have received. It is, therefore, with special pleasure I speak to you, particularly the younger members present here.</p>
		<p>You have just imbibed most of what a university can impart to you and are now on the threshold of facing life in all its diversities and complexities. While it is hoped that what you have received is of value to guide you through life and give you discernment to gauge the events occurring around you, there are still, in spite of the education we have all received, many things that happen around us which leave us in a state of confusion and bewilderment. I refer here not to the problem of transition that our country is passing through from a backward, feudal, colonial status to a modern industrialised society, but to doubts assailing us on what was considered of permanent value to our civilisation itself. While some of it can be attributed to the impact of Western ideas on our incredibly rich Sanskritic origins, the major impact comes﻿ from the great advances science and technology has made during the last 50 years. I venture to express my views on some of these, particularly because of my close and long association with scientists and I trust we all believe that science has many new things to tell us yet. In my address, I propose to analyse how some of our traditional values have been forced to re-examination in the light of new developments and if a change is required, how then do we react to it, especially if we are to survive as an identifiable cultural force in the world. Our roots and contributions of the past have been so deep and rich in value that a complete replacement does not seem warranted, but a re-examination leading to suitable transformation is certainly necessary. Adapt or perish, that is and always has been the implacable law of life in the biological sense and this is true of our cultural moves too.</p>
		<p>While all advances in science do not as yet support the existence of an Almighty God who guides our destinies, in any clear scientific terms, there is enough. scope to say that this is as yet an insettled question: We, however, realise that arguments based on Aristotalean logic and scientific reasoning, as we know it, do not require this assumption, but the discovery of Quantum Mechanics during the earlier part of this century was itself a rude shock to those who viewed the world as﻿ a purely mechanistic system. That the world is guided by newer laws than those, not obvious to the eye has become evident from the successes of the new mechanics. Determinism has given place to indeterminism at least in the atomic world and all laws are to be interpreted in a probabilistic manner. Mathematics itself which was considered as the paragon of rational thinking has begun to manifest inconsistencies and incompleteness in its very foundations. In spite of this living in a world in which the more mundane aspects of the advances of science and technology are having a profound effect on our lives, it is obvious we cannot ignore their influence on our spiritual lives.</p>
		<p>In addition to the progress made in the exact and technological sciences, the recent advances made in the life sciences, particularly in understanding the structure and dynamics of the Cell, its co-operative behaviour and the laws that govern genetics, will certainly have a profound effect in determining the position of Man in the universe. Man's attempt to conquer space has certainly shown that at last in the solar system, his position is unique. No life recognisable as having the same qualities as the human species seems to exist in the rest of our solar system. However, it seems to be an impossibility to know of the immediate existence of life in the rest of our galaxy and the outer universe, as﻿ signalling to these outer worlds is itself restricted in time because of the finite velocity of our fastest signals, i.e., light. We may at best eventually get to know of what might have existed in these far off worlds several million years ago. It is strange that while in our laboratories we are now in a position to measure very accurately time intervals of very much less than a thousandth millionth of a second called a nano second, communication to outer space will always remain a very slow operation; certainly well beyond the finite span of human life.</p>
		<p>Whatever be our philosophical ideas on the meaning of the word "existence", "physical existence" can be demonstrated with great confidence, be it in regions of 10-13 cms. or distances several million light years away. Such is the power of modern science. But, we. note that all physical measurements, however dependent on sophisticated instrumentation has to be evaluated finally by the brain. In the end it is human consciousness which decides ultimate reality. The true meaning of reality can therefore be understood only in the context of the working of the brain both in isolation and in the interaction of one with another, either through our sense organs, i.e., the eye, the ear etc., or even directly if this is possible.</p>
		<p>The overall feeling one gets of our cul'ture and philosophy, and I make these statements fully knowing that I am no expert on﻿ the subject, is that great importance is placed on the individual self in the assessment of what</p>
		<p>imate truth. The individual and his perception of the universe is given a pre-eminent position in all our ancient writings: I wish to bring to your attention an aspect of modern science where it is shown that collective behaviour of interacting units are more important than individual behaviour and it is the nature of this interaction between entities that plays a key role in our understanding of the universe.</p>
		<p>You may be aware that in studying microscopic structures, one first identifies the individual building block or unit and then studies its individual and collective characteristics. In the case of physical matter, it is the atom which constitutes the unit. The structure of the atom determines its entire chemistry and the mutual interaction between atoms determines all observable physical properties of matter. The study of the properties of matter nowadays means the understanding of the complicated interaction between atoms. This approach has given rise to several new developments in modern technology and to name one such is the solid state device, the transistor. As you all know, this has revolutionised communication. The situation in the case of the atomic nucleus is even more complex than that of the atom. Here the constituent particles are protons and neutrons, the nature﻿ of whose mutual interactions is still not quite understood though we know that they give rise, under special circumstances to energy releases of unbelievable magnitude as for example, in a nuclear device or a reactor. It is now the general view of all physicists that in the study of elementary particles, the nature of the particles by themselves have no immediate significance, but the study of the interaction between them constitutes modern physics and represents the forefront of basic science. We note that as yet no consistent pattern has appeared in the understanding of elementary particles. It is almost like in a game of chess, for one who does not know the game where the actual entities are made of wood or ivory but the rules of the game make it mysterious.</p>
		<p>The other microscopic region of study where the building blocks play a vital role in the understanding of the origin and purpose of life is the biological cell. While considerable progress has been made on the detailed structure of the cell and its molecular properties, we are far from understanding intercellular behaviour. Its behaviour is certainly amazing especially when we consider how the normal human system works where each cell acts according to a well organised co-operative system with respect to the other. It is even more amazing when something goes berserk as in the case of cancer. Here, you find some﻿ of the cells taking control of the situation to work against the general well being of the system and even the normal cells begin to take orders from the malignant ones to make the destruction quicker and more complete. It is not my intention to describe to you all the new advances made in understanding intercellular behaviour or the new information we have on the working of the brain and other biological phenomena, but to bring to your attention how even at the microscopic level the behaviour of systems have a certain likeness to the behaviour of an integrated system such as man: Man by himself in isolation is a fantastic structural unit. His power of thinking and putting into action his ideas are quite unbelievable, especially considering his size. One has merely to compare him with a small computer which does a very much lesser number of operations. In spite of this, man in isolation is not such an interesting object of study as man in interaction with other fellow human beings. If you can bear with me, I place such a great importance on this inter-man behaviour that I would like to associate its existence with the Supreme Brahman of the Vedas itself.</p>
		<p>We sometimes come across similar to that of a diseased malignant cell, where one group of human beings try to destroy the other and therefore the entire community. Human society, very similar to repair mechanism of cells, in order to protect itself against﻿ such possibilities and introduce stability has evolved for itself various types of constraints to social behaviour. Grouping of sets of individuals is a common manifestation. At the moment, the criteria for grouping seems to be based on religion, profession and language. In our history, language has played an important part in the rise of our great culture. While it is something we should be so proud of, it has become a stumbling block to the integration of this great country of ours. We seem to concentrate on its narrower aspect and forget its greatness. For economic and other reasons, we have developed social systems to segregate ourselves into castes which in my opinion, whatever may be its value in the past, serves no purpose now. Everybody should be prepared to undertake any work from lofty and exalted philosophical reflection down to the most mental of tasks, and yet remain honoured members of the society.</p>
		<p>In spite of the weakness of our society as exists, we have thrown up people of high quality to give the right leadership and at the right time. This is the main reason why I call our country great, but more often than is good for us, we produce people who merely elbow themselves into positions of power without any particular qualities of constructive leadership. Society therefore requires protective devices to contain and counteract the role of such people. Our system has in﻿ deed developed inherent feed backs to fight against those initiating malignant and retrograde processes, but we have to ask ourselves, are these repair processess good enough for our times. As I see it, the only corrective processes we have, is the maintenance of law and order through judiciaries, through Parliament etc. Is this sufficient ? Should it not be more through our innate sense of fair play and a regard and love for one another. It seems tragic to me that in recent times that the very definition of fair play and love for a fellow being has been distorted. Physical cruelty to the weak and disabled seems to be an accepted norm of our society. Coming as I do from an overcrowded city, the amount of cruelty shown to women and children makes me wonder whether we have any philosophy left at all.</p>
		<p>Be that as it may, let us ask ourselves the question what is it that ensures that cruelty and callousness do not become an accepted part of our society. There is no doubt that in the past religion both in its elementary form and its highly sophisticated aspects provided a stronger base than legislation for sustaining a human society. The sophisticated aspect of religion relying on the spiritual identity of man can but influence only a few, but the elementary form of religion which provides some kind of a corrective feed back process does indeed influence a large number of people, but operates on a large component of irrational superstition. Can. we allow this to continue or should we replace it and if so by what? In my view, all superstitions and other manifestations of ignorance are evils and are motivated by selôshness. In my early years, I recall the cruelty meted out to widows in the name of Karma and Dharma. This is something that this country can never cleanse itself from. I ask you that whenever you are forced with a decision involving a challenge, da not be guided by superstition. Have courage to face up to your decision's and take full responsibility for it. If at the spur of the moment you feel unable to do this, get the help of progressive company around you, but do not revert to superstition.</p>
		<p>I am not suggesting that you should not believe in the higher things that manifest themselves in the material world. In fact, I am a great believer in intuition and as things stand, intuition is the only way complicated problems can be approached. You will recall that in science, prediction is possible only if one has all the necessary information to solve a set of equations which describe the behaviour of a given system. Exact solutions are possible in simple cases. Perhaps, a computer can be used for the more complicated cases. In science, this is called the solution of a many body problems and presents itself in a formidable way in understanding the behaviour of﻿ a system of nucleons, system of atoms or a system of cells, each with its own degree of complexity. It is clearly impossible to use the present many body problem methods of science in predicting the behaviour of man. But this, however, does not mean that on some pseudo-scientific basis, one can claim to predict a man's future. If people are impressed by coincidences, by clever guess work, it may be that it satisfies their ego, their selfish wants, but certainly, there is no science behind this method of prediction. There are, of course the possibilities of the human brain intuitively responding to a set of circumstances, at least to determine which is the right path to take and which is not. In the exercises of one's intuition, the path must clearly be one which does not simply allow the self or individual to prosper but it must be for the benefit of the community without any differentiation towards opportunities. Unfortunately, we have to admit that the human species being what it is, all brains do not have the same characteristics, some have more discrimination, some have more intuition and many neither. But at no stage is there need for cruelty, callousness and destructive cynicism to enter because of these inherent difference.</p>
		<p>In this short address, I have attempted perhaps in an imperfect fashion, to outline before you the mutuality of interactions in the atomic, sub-atomic, cellular and intra-cellular﻿ world in relation to the more integrated organismic and human levels and how these are inextricably interwoven into the tapestry of Indian culture and moves. It is essentially a personal view arising from my own experience and background.</p>
		<p>Before I conclude, I would like to take the opportunity of wishing you all the best that Life has to offer you and you in turn will spare nothing on your part to help this great country of ours and promise not to do anything which will destroy its foundations. It deserves all the devotion you can give it. Nowhere in the world is there a country with such a glorious past and a promise of a great future in spite of all its diversities and discontinuities. It only requires young people like you to let it flower into real greatness.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY ERIC STOKES on Sunday, 6th Feb. 1977<br />Mr. VICE-CHANCELLOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />AND GRADUATES OF THE YEAR</h1>
		<p>It is a particular privilege and distinction to be</p>
		<p>asked to address this Convocation, especially as I appear among you as quite the newest of your graduates. In doing me these personal honours I would like to think that you are also acknowledging the connexion of Mysore University with the wider international academic community. A university, as its name implies, is a society that aspires to universal knowledge, and though set in a particular place belongs to the world of learning at large. Now whatever the undoubted gains that have accrued from the massive expansion of higher education throughout the world since 1945, an enhapcement of the open, universal, international character of universities has not been among them. The reasons are clear. Impelled by the forces clamouring for material development national governments have turned to the university as the chosen instrument for producing their most advanced echelons of trained man-power (under the Sex Anti-Discrimination Act in Britain we are now almost required to say—“people power"). But the profuse financial bounty that has been showered on university education, especially in the west, has steadily increased the dependence of the universities on the State, and their subordination to it.﻿</p>
		<p>Even an ancient university like my own, with traditions of self-government going back to the thirteenth century, has found itself caught up in a tide that is cutting away the foundations on which its old independence was founded. The private financial endowments of Cambridge University and of the autonomous Colleges, though still substantial, represent a relatively minor part of their overall income. Dependence on State finance has inevitably meant indirect State influence in academic policy making, in the decisions on the number of staff and the subjects to be expanded or contracted.</p>
		<p>Our students are largely supported by State maintenance awards; our tuition fees are paid by public authorities who must be consulted over any alteration of their amount. By the constraints of the system of block grants we have felt obliged to obey governmental behests and raise the fees charged to overseas students to nearly double that levied on ordinary students. Applicants from abroad have to satisfy stringent immigration requirements. Even overseas academic staff wishing to call at British universities on their way elsewhere often find the immigration formalities intimidating. Our private funds for inviting longer-staying academic visitors have been eroded by inflation, and overseas governments are known to look with a jealous eye on private exchanges as carrying with them the danger of foreign interference. University research has increasingly come under the aegis of﻿ semi-governmental national research councils, so that a British scholar wishing for funds to work abroad must first gain approval of his project from such a body. He has then to gain access to the country of his choice and in many parts of the world obtain approval of his project from the government of that country. For their part governments in seeking to promote closer relations with another country blithely sign cultural exchange agreements providing for the interchange of academic visits without any consultation with the academic community. Hence scholars came to be despatched more in the character of national representatives than as individuals pursuing their own line of inquiry and research.</p>
		<p>I, therefore, point to a general world phenomenon when I state that the power of governments over the university world has increased and is increasing. It is not a condition for which any particular country or government is to blame, and there is an element of hypocrisy if we try to point an accusing finger. For the situation is one which we may deplore as scholars but which we have willed as citizens. It is the price we pay for the powerful drive of governments to improve our material lot, to allocate scarce resources, and to respond to our nationalist urges to control the entry and activity of foreigners in our countries. For these we have let go the nineteenth century world of minimal government, unfettered private initiative and enterprise, free international move﻿ment of persons, and a large measure of university autonomy. The university has not been a chosen victim. Every sphere of cultural life has been brought into the politico-governmental world, including international sport and even the Miss World Competition. Nevertheless we have a situation in which although universities and their international contacts have been multiplied in gross, they have been drawn into a steadily narrowing national setting and much of their old independence and power of initiative has been draihed away to strong national governments at the centre. In this sense their universality and open international character have been impaired. Does this matter? I think it does.</p>
		<p>The proper function of learning is to bring the individual into communication with a mental world larger than the one he naturally inhabits. Its purpose is to release him from the narrow bonds of his immediate time and place and make him free- of a world of mental discourse that knows no boundaries of community, nation or race. In the field of the natural sciences the international or universal nature of learning is not open to question. Scientists have always been the most internationally minded members of the academic community and the least affected by pational prepossessions. To governments it is also abundantly plain that their scientists must be afforded the fullest and freest access to the international scientific community if their talents are to be most fully developed in the national﻿ interest. In the humanities the need for outside contact is much less obvious, since scholars in these disciplines are often concerned with some local facet of their own national cultures and communities. The humanities splinter much more naturally into localized compartments, so that while a science syllabus will be more or less common throughout much of the world a humanities syllabus will not. Moreover, the humanities appear to have no immediate cash value in terms of promoting economic development, and hence have been least favoured by governments with aid to overcome their localization by more frequent and abundant contact with the international academic community. Yet paradoxically these are in many ways the subjects that are most in need of opening a window on the wider universe, because although, like women seemingly weak and ineffectual on a superficial view, it is their hands that rock the cradle and rule the world. For in our general views and political persuasions we are all ultimately products of the conditioning we undergo from the men who handle words, whether' politicians, officials, administrators, teachers, journalists, or broadcasters. And the ideas they purvey are drawn from a general culture outside the special truths of natural science and technology. The humanities and in some measure the social sciences remain the most powerful source of this general culture which suffuses our newspapers and the spoken public word. Hence in the intellectual sphere the﻿ liberty of the mind and its ability to range across Frontiers is in the end of supreme importance, for in this sphere of general culture ignorance or what is worse, half knowledge, carries the most damaging consequences. In every country we are in constant danger of being shut into the narrow thought world of our particular national culture in its most introvert form. The danger to the British people of such insularity of mind has long been apparent, an insularity which can be defined, to transpose a phrase of the late G. M. Young, as "introspection within a closed circle of experience". I would have thought that India faced similar dangers though a different set of problems. Her vital need is to fashion a general culture which is modern though essentially Indian, and which couched in the language of universal communication-English-remains a natural, spontaneous, and creative expression of Indian life. Such a culture cannot be introspective; it must be outgoing. The function of a university anywhere is to foster an autonomous intellectual discipline by which men and women can view their immediate local and personal prejudices with some measure of detachment. Academics do not, of course, live up to this ideal in ordinary life. They are fallible human beings, concerned like the rest of mankind with promotion and pay, and swept at times by gusts of political love or hate. Yet even in their most impassioned and prejudiced moods they continue to recognize dimly the vital impor﻿tance of keeping the argument open, and they appeal even in the height of controversy to some objective standard of judgement springing from a wider overarching cultural framework. That objective standard may be for us no more sometimes than the hard view taken of us by the outside world.</p>
		<p>If, therefore, the need to keep a window open on the wider world is peculiarly important in sustaining this larger cultural framework, then the position of the least favoured elements of the university community-the humanities-requires to be looked at with more discernment. Their need to keep open communication with the international academic community is in the end no less vital than for the scientist. I am impressed, for example, how few university teachers of the humanities whom I have met in India have effective opportunities to pay academic visits elsewhere, either in India or abroad.</p>
		<p>There is a further issue. The influence of governments over universities has not merely elevated the latter's national stance at the expense of its international stance. It has also tended to weaken the springs of self-government, self-help, and self-initiative. The pattern of centrally guided research by national research councils threatens the springs of individual spontaneity which is the source of all creativity. Now it has always been one of the great traditions of true liberalism to oppose the dominant forces of the age, not to overthrow them but to prevent their﻿ excessive dominance. In Britain in the last century Matthew Arnold stood up to oppose the prevailing current which ran strong in favour of lais sez faire and the absence of all governmental interference. Today the pendulum has swung far the other way and the liberal needs to exercise bis strength in an opposite direction. Not because he is opposed to state power as such and wishes to displace it, but because he does not wish it to grow so powerful as to negate the ultimate end it is designed to secure, the spontaneity and capacity for initiative of the individual. This at least is one of our perennial concerns in university circles in Britain, and I suspect that it is not absent here.</p>
		<p>Mr. Vice-Chancellor, these are ponderous remarks for what is by nature a happy occasion. Yet I thought it useful to show that British and Indian universities share problems that differ in degree rather than kind. From what I have learned of Mysore University they are not problems which press too heavily upon you; and you appear to have adopted your own vigorous remedies. I was delighted to read in the Diamond Jubilee Number of the Mysore University Gazette of the permanent and practical way the university had decided to commemorate its first sixty glorious years. It has renewed its appeal for the Golden Jubilee Foundation, begun in 1966, whose purpose is to use private gifts for the promotion of scholarship and research, for the founding of new chairs, and for the provision of equipment. I was interested,﻿ above all, in the proposals to institute visiting professorships and lectureships, to promote international understanding by staff exchanges, and to make travel grants and loans for promising teachers and researchers to study abroad.</p>
		<p>Such a foundation meets all the objectives set out in my earlier reflections. Mysore University is strengthening the sources of local initiative, looking other than to Government for financial help, reaching out to the world beyond Mysore and bringing that world back to its doorstep From the record of the past sixty years it is evident-to use Othello's modest understatementthat you have done the State some service. In enlarţing the range of your external contacts you are not, I think, indulging the private interests of individuals. India can only benefit from increased contacts with the outside world. In Singapore and Malaysia last year I was-much struck by the absence of contact with Indian universities and the small extent to which India was studied in a region with which India has had close cultural and historical ties. Presumably if India is to pursue an informed foreign policy this isolation of her educated classes from so vital an area will have to be rapidly overcome, and I gather that institutes of South East Asian Studies are being set up or expanded in a number of Indian universities. The same absence of Indian academic contacts is also observable in Africa despite the fact of the common bond of an English language culture. Mysore University﻿ has not been backward in its international connections, although not perhaps with these particular areas. The record of academic visitors in all your major departments, and of the visits of your own academic staff overseas, demonstrates a lively and healthy concern to keep Mysore an 'open' university in the very broadest sense.</p>
		<p>I would like Mr. Vice-Chancellor to feel that my presence here today is a token and pledge of the good-will which Cambridge and the British academic world bears towards your university. For myself, returning to Mysore is a source of great personal pleasure. One does not readily forget the place where one attained the age of majority or heard the awesome news of the dropping of the first atomic bomb. I was then merely a subaltern in an Indian mountain artillery regiment which formed part of 26th Indian Division as it lay poised at Vadigenhalli in August 1945, ready to spring forward for the assault on Malaya. The world has changed a great deal since that date and India with it, but the countryside of Karnataka still wears a smiling face and breathes the same balmy climate. Among the British there is a special affection for this land, an affection that ranges beyond the attractions of Ooty. Some of our greatest names are connected with it. Wellington, whose figure even now adoras our five-pound notes, was taught his sharpest lessons in military science by Tipu at Srirangapatnam. Lord Macaulay, whose complete letters are now being published by the﻿ Cambridge University Press, wrote some of his liveliest descriptive prose in relating the scenic beauties of Mysore when in 1834 he was carried up the ghats from Madras and made his way to Ootacamund to take his place in the GovernorGeneral's Council. A still more famous man, Winston Churchill, developed such an attachment to India when he was a young cavalry officer in these 'parts in the 1890's that as an old man in 1947 he could not bring himself to accept the necessity of severing the political tie between Britain and India, despite the almost unanimous voice of both British and Indian opinion.</p>
		<p>It is, Sir, with these historic associations between us that I'thank you for asking me to address this Convocation today. May I offer the other new graduates the most cordial congratulations in the confident hope that they will go out into the world to swell the ranks of the university's ambassadors who are scattered far and wide in this country and beyond the seas. So long as the parent trunk of Mysore University is firmly rooted in Karnatak soil, every branch which it throws up into the outside world can only give it fresh nourishment and strength. Thus, long have you flourished. Long may you do so!﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY ASHOK MITRA<br />on Saturday, 23rd Apr.1978</h1>
		<p>The University of Mysore has done me a great honour in inviting me to this august Convocation, I am a renegade from the world of learning; it is only your tolerance for an acknowledged maverick which justifies my presence here. This kindness overwhelms me.</p>
		<p>The occasion demands that I should address a few words to the young scholars who have been formally conferred their degrees today. It is a proud day for them, but it is also a day which adds to their load of responsibility. The burden of this nation rests squarely on them. What is the import of this burden? How is the educational system as it obtains at present relevant to the apportionment, and sharing, of this burden ?</p>
		<p>As I see it, there are three ways of looking at education. It is in the first place a public good to which all ought to have equal right and access. Like water, air and light, education too should be available on demand to the citizens of a free country. Education in this sense is a stock, a stock to draw upon, which allows the constituents of the community to improve their minds and raise the level of their awareness. One talks of adult suffrage and the right to vote for each citizen. But this right loses its significance if it is not accompanied by the much more primal right of education.</p>
		<p>The second aspect of education is perhaps an extension of the first, but is equally relevant.﻿ Education is the imbibing of skill, skill that is needed if one wants to qualify for a profession or livelihood. Here again, the crucial element is that of stock-building, the garnering of an addi-. tional asset. In a free society, each citizen should normally have the right to choose the skill he intends to specialise in and to have as much opportunity as his neighbour for obtaining the training and education required for the development of that particular skill. True, there would be a problem of resource-constrain here ; formation of any skill is a function of certain investment activities and investments imply a draft on resources since the imparting of some skills is more resource-using than others; the question of a proper allocation of resources is bound to arise. The expectation would still seem reasonable that, in a country given to the observance of democratic norms, whatever resources are available should be so distributed as to ensure the equitable spread of skill-formation as between the different members of the community.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, in our country neither of these two aspects of education has been in command. Primary education, which should be a free public good, is yet to filter down to the millions and millions of the poorer households. In the countryside, those who either do not have any land or have only meagre morsels of it remain outside the pale of education; the State has been able to do little to redress the situation in the course of the past thirty years. Outside the rural sector, the situation is no less murky. By and large, the dispossessed are disinherited from the educational process too. The causality is of a multiple kind. A large number amongst those who are poor are unable to partake of the opportunity to educate themselves because they use their time scrounging for food ; education is a luxury. which they simply cannot afford. At the same time, the poor do not have the means with which to get themselves educated either ; poverty and illiteracy are heavily inter-correlated.</p>
		<p>The situation is obviously much worse in the case of the upper layers of the educational process, leading to advanced skill formation of some genre or other. In the very high reaches of learning, the children of the poor are a near-negligible category. This gives rise to a phenomenon which is not just self-perpetuating; it is actually selfaggravating. Those who have the assets corner the opportunities for additional skill formation, enabling them to acquire more income and assets, which in turn leads to the possibility of their acquiring even more skills, while the poor are left out in the cold. It is still only through sheer accident os happenstance that children from poor families can, as late as even today, hope to obtain higher education, including scientific and technical education.</p>
		<p>There is however a third aspect of education I wanted to talk about. Even amongst the fortunate few who succeed in breaking into the arena﻿ of higher education, a process of attrition begins to work. The rationale for acquiring additional skills is that, with these skills, one would succeed in earning a wage higher than one could have expected otherwise; in other words, skill-differentials are the key to wage-differentials. But it has not been happening that way at all in our country. Only a minor fraction of those who emerge out of our universities, technical schools and engineering and medical colleges have been able to secure an earning commensurate with their expectations. A substantial number have discovered to their awe and consternation that employment opportunities are shrinking with each day, and society has little use for their skills. In particular, developments in the country since the mid-1960's constitute a sombre story, with hundreds of thousands swelling the crowd of the socalled educated unemployed. This fact notwithstanding, we find, year in and year out, a continuous addition to the crowd seeking higher education. Education has suddenly become much like an indeterminate, interminable tunnel. Those who are reluctant to enter the labour market wait out in this tunnel. They are reluctant to emerge out of it, because at the end of it awaits uncertainty, uncertainty about jobs and earnings. Education is hence converted into an elongated process. Young men and women, willy nilly, remain students because, they apprehend, once they arrive at the terminus, only a nominal switch in their identity will take place: they will cease to be﻿ students, only to join the vast reserve army of the unemployed. It is a fate which they want to postpone; they therefore hang around within the portals of educational institutions, an undecided, hazy crowd for whom education is no longer a means for advancing their skills, but has become a vestibule which keeps them away from the fate of joblessness.</p>
		<p>I am hardly exaggerating. Even as I face the young men and women who are passing out today, the overriding emotion I have is one of guilt and sadness. I wish I could have some extra words of cheer for them. But that would be an exercise in hypocrisy. The graduates of the University of Mysore -are, I have to assume, a representative cross-section of the graduates all over the country. Only a few amongst them can, at the present juncture, look forward to receiving in life the kind of reward which they would consider to be adequate <em>quid pro quo </em>for their education and skills. This is the reality.</p>
		<p>It is this reality which reminds us that the national economy has been in a state of near atrophy for almost fifteen years now. There bas been growth, but only just about to take care of the rising population. There has been growth, but the expansion of industrial and commercial activities had been of a most modest order. There has been growth in agriculture too, but it has been highly selective and beyond a point, has not been shared by all sections of the community. We cannot ignore the stark fact of a certain lack﻿ of impulse in the different segments of the economy. There are exceptions to this story, but not of such moment as to obliterate its central message. Our graduates fail to obtain gainful employment, because the economy is languishing. Each year, our institutions produce hundreds of engineers, scientists and other technical people ; they produce graduates in commerce and economics ; they produce other graduates who are wonderfully proficient in the liberal arts; yet, a huge number from amongst them soon discover that the nation has little use for the additional skills they have accumulated. It is all a cry of sellers, sellers of skills, with but few buyers.</p>
		<p>This is what reduces the educational system in the country to such a pitiful state. At the end of the tunnel there is only further darkness. There is an apparent inversion of roles; the tunnel, which allows our young ones to wait out, becomes a symbol of security; it is the end of it which is full of grim forebodings.</p>
		<p>We are thus faced with a conundrum. At one end, education, which should be a public good and, at the same time, is a skill-augmenting asset, is currently the prerogative of a very limited proportion of the population, the nation's majority remaining beyond its pale; at the other end only a handful of even those who receive the bounty of this precious asset are assured of a secure future. Of those who pass out of the universities, a bare few are fortunate enough to receive conventional social acclaim;﻿ their skills are recognised inside the country, and occasionally outside. Some amongst them can even command an international clientele. They can, if they so choose, leave the country and enjoy a high life-style in richer lands; some so choose. Those who are left behind engage in a fierce competition amongst themselves to corner the severely restricted opportunities for comfortable existence that are available in this poor, near-stagnant country. Once the lucky ones have been sorted out, the rest join the vast non-descript crowd of the hapless and the mediocrities, who have little to look forward to and for whom opportunity is often denied for class-biased reasons.</p>
		<p>At this point, I would like to append one or two humble comments which my young friends will not, I hope, take amiss. It is perhaps time to perceive that there is an organic link between the fact that a majority of the nation are denied educational opportunities and the other fact that a great number of those who do receive education nonetheless cannot fulfil their aspirations. Disenchantment awaits the latter, the realities of the economy hold them back. These realities are those of retarded economic growth, and the lack of expansion of industry and commerce, agriculture and crafts, science and technology. An intense kind of interdependence, characterises economic activities; once one specific activity is held back, others 'too are affected pari passu. Without appreciable economic expansion, employ﻿ment is adversely affected, and as employment opportunities peter out, income and demand for goods and services level off too; there is then a further recession in economic activities. It is a perfect empirical correlate of that worn-out expression, low-level equilibrium.</p>
		<p>It could have been altogether otherwise, however. It can still be. If, instead of being burdened by a rate of illiteracy of around 70 per cent in the country, as a whole and much more in the countryside, we were able to spread the bounty of education more evenly across the population, a different situation would have emerged. Education-even elementary educationwould have led to an awakening of consciousness on the part of the poor. No greater capital asset than this awareness is conceivable. It would have made the poor realise the factors underlying the distance, social as well as economic, between them and the favoured ones. From this awareness would have come a certain cohesiveness within their fold, which could have strengthened their determination to demand an increased proportion of national assets and earnings. Education would have led to a sharpening of the hunger for land, the hunger for higher wages, the hunger for a larger share of the crop on the part of the share-croppers, for a larger share of the available irrigation facilities, of bank and co-operative loans, of pesticides, of seeds and diverse other amenities provided either directly by the State or under its auspices. This awareness would have﻿ led to a more even sharing of the nation's assets. Many other things would then have followed. The enlarged income of the poor would have led to an enlargement of the purchasing power across-the-board, which in turn would have led to a widening and deepening of the market. This would have resulted in the intensification of demand for farm products and industrial goods, for commercial and service activities, and for inputs of various sorts. The sum-total would have been a pulsating increase in the rate of economic growth, from which the entire nation would have benefited. The economy would have hummed, work and employment opportunities would have multiplied, scientific and research would have flourished, the texture of the horizon would have been transformed for our young people.</p>
		<p>We thus have to begin, to re-tread the cliche, at the very beginning. If today even for the limited few, who are blessed by the advantage of advanced education, the future seems more or less uniformly bleak, the answer has to be sought in the other fact that educational opportunities have been confined to these few. If the younger generation are to be ensured a greater order of security, they would have to grapple with the problem on their own. I would plead with them to form a lobby, a lobby which will plead that educational opportunities are not kept cornered by a handful, but are spread out all over. It is in this generosity that. I feel, lie the class interests of those who are represented in this hall this morning.</p>
		<p>And this campaign should mean bits and pieces of other things too. It is the advance of the poor which can contribute most effectively to economic growth and, therefore, to jobs and enhanced earnings for the hitherto privileged, including the graduates who are getting their degrees today. Attend to the poor and the under-privileged and the flood-gate of opportunities will be opened for you. This is not altruism, but enlightened self-interest. Education has given you added skills, use these skills to serve the cause of the poor. The poor do have but meagre resources, so adapt your skills in order that the poor can raise their productivity at relatively low investment. Use your skills for evolving a technology which suits the poor. Once the poor survive and advance, the rest of us in society would too. Education is for self-enlightenment; there can be no greater self-enlightenment than the realisation that the poor and the disinherited are very much a part of an integrated system to which we all belong. I hope my young friends agree; even if they do not, I hope they will agree to debate my proposition. A university education, after all, is for opening the doors and windows of the mind.</p>
		<p>I thank you all.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY K. SHIVARAMA KARANTH<br />on Saturday, 21 Apr.1979</h1>
		<p>Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Graduates of the University, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>
		<p>My first duty is to thank this University for having committed an initial" blunder" in 1963 by conferring on me' a doctorate and now more so by requesting me to deliver today's Convocation address. This I do with humility and gratitude. Though I had at one time, enlisted myself as a student of the Madras University, my studentship lasted no longer than 7 months, thanks to Gandhiji who in 1922 goaded me to give it up in preference to a much larger job of serving the cause of Indian freedom. I am glad that I did so, for it taught me that India was bigger than myself and also the Madras University and during later years I discovered that this universe itself was too vast, for comprehension by the mind of any single individual, in a life time. Had I finished my University I would have become one like, any average graduate, who normally comes out of its portals, feeling relieved of the big bother of passing examinations. I would then have gone hunting after security of my own life, at the expense of everything else, this wonderful world had to offer me.</p>
		<p>. This has given me a chance to interest myself in many things, that concern man, his past and present. Such an enterprise is﻿ vast. It is so baffling and intriguing as much as interesting and ever inspiring. My pursuit has shown me that an individual's life has a definite end, but the process of enquiry and learning has no end at all. As such I have read a little bit, about the activities of a few Universities, here and abroad. This was a sort of inference, which drew from the writings, of many scholars, who conducted pioneer studies, in varied branches of exact Sciences, Social Sciences and if I am permitted to coin a term, "inexact” or speculative Sciences.</p>
		<p>I feel that a University which trains young people in order to fit themselves into a larger world, ought to create first of all a love for learning. It has to inspire the pupils for ardent carving out a vaster and deeper understanding of the place of man in this universe. No doubt I am suggesting a never ending task. You would terrify him by the enormity of the project for his action starts with the little place he lives on this earth; life and other problems prevailing here so that he can adjust himself to his surrounding in order to live harmoniously with multitudes of other species that made a home, here before man himself. I would be content with this pilot scheme before aspiring after still more distant things and questions.</p>
		<p>Do we stimulate such hunger for knowledge and sponser such activities or research﻿ on unknown aspects of life and its problems about History and its implications about the beauties and the pleasures that life can offer us and about creative Arts ?</p>
		<p>Acquainting oneself with things already known and then probing into the unknown is such a vast enterprise that would warrant ignoring a hundred failures to one bit of success.</p>
		<p>Those of you who would agree with me with the above objectives will have to agree with me that these ambitions cannot be realised by medicore brains who have no zeal, no sense of wonder, no curiosity but are only satisfied with memorising facts and repeat them whenever asked to do so. Men who feel amply satisfied if given a prestigious place and a comfortable purse are not the ones that could handle such an adventure. They cannot draw or discover talent in themselves, or draw them out of their students. That is possible by men, who by themselves are thirsty after knowledge. They by their personality can infuse such a zeal, in students. They can by instinct spot out talent and encourage students in varried branches of knowledge so that they too become everinquisitive. To them further knowledge becomes their reward, in life. Society would provide them with all creative comforts. Such craze for knowledge does not end with a comfortable job. Even after retirement﻿ they will not seek comfort in Bhajan Parties, I know very well that such zealous persons are not to be found in large numbers. Universities to be Universities should go after such seekerst after knowledge if they have to be worth the name. It is only when such scholars inspire and guide the youngyou are bound to have a crop of intellectual enthusiasts-in every University. Their labour, research and achievements are bound to reflect on the intellectual prosperity of a nation. The nation benefits; and such benefits can pass beyond a country's borders</p>
		<p>During the thirties, I read a book about the activities of Illinois University by Sudhindra Bose. A student who came there wanted to specialise, in the 'Culture of Crow-Indians'. The University had no chair for such a study. They could have said 'No' and asked him to choose some other course of study which they could offer. The Crow-Indians are a group original inhabitants of the United States of America. They still live there, and are treated as primitives of the land by the American colonisers. The Illinois University thought, it fit to create a special chair for studies on the Crow-Indian language and culture. All this for a single student. We would have thought it utter waste of public money thus betraying our narrow attitude towards knowledge. We would not﻿mind wasting money by creating a chair for the sake of persons whom we like, but not for subjects in general. Knowledge is knowledge to us if only it would help us to feed one's belly, but not the brain. Otherwise it is impossible to think of the place given to Sanskrit in our Universities. To us it is only a dead language. It was this and another dead language <em>Pali,</em> which store the best of the Indian cultural and intellectual tradition.</p>
		<p>Both these languages reflected the intellectual life of our country, all our thought processes and our logic. Our religious teachings as well as philosophical attitudes were expressed through them. Every aspect of life and living had to face challenges from scholars of the age. Hence they were virile and not docile. It is not only the languages but also their contents that ought to receive due respect and attention by us. What we call Indian Culture is the product of so many challenging intellectual reflections and beliefs of the past.</p>
		<p>We have been blindly accepting the choice of subjects of studies from the West. We imitate their curricula. So far as modren sciences are concerned this is a necessity but not so in everything. A number of subjects have to deal with problems of our own society and country. Unless our teachers become research-minded in all aspects, we can only be imitators, content with copying﻿ their curricula. After doing so, we begin to set a premium on memorising of texts. Examinations mean recapturing what one has memorised. Let it be any subject unless the mode of presentation of a subject depends on the arousal of interest, making the student to investigate, to think and then make the subject part of his accepted beliefs it is no education.</p>
		<p>It needs a professor of a different kind to whom a discipline is a live issue. His own learning has not ended and during the entire period of his teaching career he is in touch with all researches that are going on about the subject. It is such a person who inakes his students alive to the problems of the world.</p>
		<p>We have now reduced all this to-memorising facts, and teaching and learning of the same oriented to the demands of an examination paper.</p>
		<p>What is the place of research in University education ? Research is a quest that you persue on your own. Is it enough if we spare a week--for it, in a whole year ? Our professors cease to be researchers any more. That pursuit ends with their Doctorate. I am not alleging that everyone is like that but many of them are surely.</p>
		<p>Your University Grants Commission has been good enough to provide funds even to retiring professors so that they may﻿ engage themselves in research. What would happen if the U.G.C. call for a report ? Both active and retired professors are doing the jobs of tutors and no more. That is because the University is content to hand down to students only accumulated knowledge of the past. They have no further ambition. Research to us is not part of Collegiate education. Our Education is supposed to be job-oriented, without in the least bothering as to what those jobs are.</p>
		<p>Ours is neither liberal education that makes one feel an elite or fits us well to particular jobs—the requirements of which we are not aware. Such omnibus education fails. in serving any social need.</p>
		<p>Prestige and popularity of Universities depend much on the prestige and brilliance of its professors. The Princeton University invited Einstein to stay with it when his theory of relativity had no immediate use. Many scientific researches do not have utilitarian objectives. But Einstein's theory shook the world of Physics and Astronomy. His equation E = mc2 resulted in unimaginable profits to every nation that was prepared to receive it.</p>
		<p>We seem to be practical minded people whose attitude towards knowledge has been equally practical. As such it is shorne of all glamour, all speculation and hence no further thirst for more of it.﻿</p>
		<p>Our text books reveal our attitude. It is enough, if our students memorise only portions, that have been prescribed to each class.</p>
		<p>To speak in a lighter vein, let me cite an example. There is the bothersome question " What is life ?". For us the answer could be " It is kicking about between birth and death”. We have reduced matters to bare essentials. Answers are to be either 'yes' or 'no'. Nothing lies in-between.</p>
		<p>From the primary class to the highest collegiate one--we think drilling factual knowledge into the brains of the young constitutes education. But a genius here and a doubter elsewhere upsets us, by opening new windows and presenting new horizons and skies. He points out the nature of black holes and quasars. He reduces the atom to constitutent energy particles. All these begin to have their own repurcussions on Applied Sciences too. Have the Universities to keep abreast of such things or not? Should they leave this job to Pure Science Research Institutes and say that is none of our job?'</p>
		<p>I am surprised at the vast multitude of young men -that flock to .our Universities.. Being an egalitarian race--we set no standards for admission. Our standards are simple ; made much more simple each year so that no seeker of the college degree is driven back. We have created an illusion in the minds of the young that a pass bestowed here will fit him into every walk of life. So, they come and come inspite of knowing that there are thousands unemployed all over the country. This number is ever increasing and in inverse ratio standards are falling</p>
		<p>If providing jobs is our aim, we have to provide suitable technical education. This we are doing too. But many of our Technical Schools and Colleges-have to cater for the needs of Industries, that are in existence and many that may get established. Their needs dictate the terms for employment. These Industries have to face world competition and consumers' preferences for price and quality.</p>
		<p>Imagine the fate of the U.S.A. a far advanced country, with capital and technology being challenged by post war Germany and Japan. Here again it is research into easier and newer ways in manufacture, that can make competition successful. Our students and graduates too will have to face it in life. Preparation for facing life in all spheres is the very concern of education.</p>
		<p>Besides, education will have to provide the means and basis for emotional and intellectual needs of man. That may not bring salary or monetary gain. But it will bring pleasure and contentment and save﻿ man from destraction and despair. Will teaching a few bits from the classics serve this purpose ? Do arts really attract our students for their own sake ?</p>
		<p>The time has come when our young men and women who flock into the Universities have to seriously think about their own future. During the time they spend in the Universities a few poor students are serious about it. Where the state provides for 66 per cent of them they feel happy, because they are much better off than their people at home.: They are not worried at all; they would like to continue here, if only you can keep them here. The prospects of white collar jobs are not plenty. Private trade or industry cannot pay as much as the Banks can. And the pupils who come out of the portalscannot think of any other job, that needs hard work.</p>
		<p>During my short sojourn in the U.S.A., I saw many college students work in restaurants as servers; and as workers in road building. It would look impudent to suggest such things to our students.</p>
		<p>Our leaders feel that the exodus of talented young men to U.S.A. or Canada is unpatriotic. But here we do not recognise. their worth. Those that have secured jobs did so by dint of hard work, showing the "Americans that to employ them would bring prosperity to their country. Shirkers of work﻿ don't have a place there. The more energetic you are, the better your pay scale and opportunity for enlarging your talents. Your contribution to the prosperity of the U.S.A. or Canada enables you to live there in comfort.</p>
		<p>With us birth and influence may count in certain areas of employment. In fields, where the tax-ayer pays for all inefficiency, it can go on but never so in a private enterprise. It is an area subject to heavy competition.</p>
		<p>At this stage, I must express my fear about the deterioration of human character among our youth. Young men normally are idealistic and sentimental in nature. It is assumed that in later life society forces them to be something different. If I am to believe-the various newspaper reports-of mass copying, threatening invigilators with dire consequences and various dubious and shameful ways adopted to pass examinations and obtain false marks cards, I feel sad about their future. Except our benign government agency no private institution may be willing to absorb such a dubious talent. The unscrupulous ways practised during student-hood, are bound to tempt him or her to shirk work and hoodwink his employers.</p>
		<p>How long will our Universities tolerate such character--deterioration ? It is telling upon the attitudes of honest, diligent and﻿ intelligent students, who may be small in number and who have begun to grumble " if honesty and diligence have no value-what next ?"</p>
		<p>Now I am nearing the end of my boring speech. Our Educators have failed the young. They failed them from the primary class onwards by making-learning distasteful. No education is possible without creating interest in the subjects taught. It was Rabindranath Tagore who when questioned by his father, on his return from England within 17 months of his stay-said 'Even English men have not made education interesting?</p>
		<p>Children are prisoners, are drilled into mercilessly by teachers. They had to bear all that. Their own curiosity, age and interests were never heeded to.</p>
		<p>Later as grown up young men they flock to colleges and revolt. They rebel for every cause, their own or the world's. You may ask me why we didn't do so, when we were studying in our colleges. Then the number who sought admissions were too few. Those who came-knew of their own poor circumstances and value of money. They strove hard because they believed that education would provide them with a livlihood.</p>
		<p>Now with thousands flock into colleges, they do so because the state takes care of﻿ two thirds of the number. Requirements for admission are reduced to the minimum. They get in by right and not by worth. The 'anasakti yoga' you taught them upto their high school stage-gets an impetus. The final stage has come. 'Just say it is the modern age. Revolt of youth is a natural phenomena. Trying to curb it may bring horrible results.</p>
		<p>Then Sir, please abdicate your place and leave all the responsibility of Teaching Curricula, Examinations, Assessment and Management to them-and seek retreat elsewhere.</p>
		<p>To you, young graduates, whatever the circumstances that have shaped your life so far, once you step into, too wide world you have to fight your own battle. Parents of many of you cannot provide you any more. You cannot reduce your newly acquired standard of life also. If you set your goalas living like men, you have to be brave. Face life squarely as crores of people are doing in our country. Shirk not your responsibility. Accept any work or toil and fit yourself for the task. At no time make your friends or employers feel that you are not to be trusted.</p>
		<p>I chose writing as my profession and carried on as best as I could. It failed to﻿ provide for me and my family, I felt insecure till I was almost Sixty years of age and I assure you I have no regrets and I have not made undue claims against my society.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Address delivered at the Sixtieth Convocation<br />(Diamond Jubilee Convocation)<br />of the University of Mysore<br />on 17th January 1980<br />by Shri Neelam Sanjeeva Reddi,<br />President of India</h1>
		<p>I am happy to be here with such a distinguished gathering, and to participate in the Diamond Jubilee Convocation of the University of Mysore. More than six decades ago, men of vision foremost among whom were the then Maharaja of Mysore and Shri M. Visveswariah, laid the foundation of this great centre of learning in the already famous and well known city of Mysore. This city, reputed for its salubrious climate, beauty, cultural and scholastic traditions has nurtured the University of Mysore which is today a premier institution for higher education in the country. This University has contributed significantly to higher education and research not only in Karnataka, but in the country as well. This is a matter in which all who have been associated with this University may feel justifiably proud. One of my distinguished predecessors in office, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, was on the faculty of this University, and had made a valuable contribution to the growth and development of this University and to its high academic renown. Many distinguished﻿ scholars like the renowned poet and scholar, Dr. K.V. Puttappa, have burnished the image of this University and made it a heaven for those seeking knowledge. It is for you who are now in the University, as teachers and students, to derive inspiration from these traditions and work with devotion for making this institution worthy of the dreams of its founding fathers. I greet the young men and women who have won academic honours and distinction today. I congratulate them on the successful completion of their academic pursuits.</p>
		<p>At the same time, I would like to remind you that today is not the end of your quest but only the beginning. The challenge of life lies ahead. There are innumerable problems for which you will have to seek appropriate solutions. The fundamental purpose of all education, and in particular higher education at the University level resolves itself ultimately to a search for such answers. By the very nature of things such a search never ceases. In conferring academic degrees on you today, this University has conferred on you the status of seekers after perfection and truth. The success you have achieved singles you out as men and women who have dedicated yourselves to use your intellectual gifts for the benefit of society at large and to provide initiatives to your fellowmen in this search for a better and brighter future. Your responsibilities in this regard are particularly onerous in a country like ours where the privilege of education and, particularly University education, is available to very few. It is my hope that you will not only uphold the ideals of this great séat of learning and dedicate yourselves to the service of our people, whose hope for the future focusses on you.</p>
		<p>Education is the key to personal enlightenment and progress. It is also the instrument of national and world progress. We cannot offer our people a better life unless we give priority to their needs in this aspect of nation building activity and be selective in the design of the educational system so that it is in harmony with aspirations and needs of our people.</p>
		<p>The compulsions of the modern social structure dynamic, competitive and ever-changing-calls for an imaginative and adaptable educational system. We stand committed to certain fundamental human values. Our educational system must reflect these national objectives and so orient itself that those goals may be achieved smoothly and with expedition. Education should not remain an insular intellectual exercise but must display its involvement in the enormous and variegated social and economic tasks which face us.</p>
		<p>Our centres of learning should be free to think and to experiment with new thoughts and ideas; and to probe the unknown and the imponderable. At the same time, they should not forget their obligations to society which conveys such freedom of thought and expression. To me this is the essence of University autonomy and academic freedom.﻿</p>
		<p>The future of our country and indeed that of mankind is in the hands of the millions of youngmen and women who are now serving their aprenticeship for life at Universities. This is at once a challenge and an opportunity. The youth of a nation are the trustees of posterity. They are a national asset of very great importance. As we plant a seed, 'and watch it germinate, grow up, flower and yield fruit, so must we watch tenderly over our young people as they take first steps forward in this march into the future. Youth has several valuable attributes. Let us channelise these into various forms of nation building activity and set before youth goals for them to achieve. We must encourage them to develop their personalities and be leaders in the glorious future which beckons to us all.</p>
		<p>Today is a great and memorable occasion for all of you who have received degrees and diplomas. Alumni of this University have enriched the life of this ancient land in many ways. I am glad that the University of Mysore has decided to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee celebrations by building a Senate Hall.</p>
		<p>As you step into the wide world, fortified with the knowledge and wisdom you have imbibed in your years at this University, I offer all of you my sincere good wishes and blessings and hope that your life ahead will be full and rewarding. May your lives always reflect the best in 'our national life and tradition.</p>
		<p>Jai Hind.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY Y. NAYUDAMMA<br />on Saturday, 7th Feb.1981<br />Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor,<br />Graduates of the year, Ladies and Gentlemen</h1>
		<p>I am conscious of the honour, you have done me in inviting me to deliver this convocation Address. The honour is all the greater recognising the rich record of Mysore University as a seat of light, liberty and learning and service to society.</p>
		<p>At the outset, allow me to offer the graduates of the year our hearty congratulations and all good wishes. Those that graduated are entering the real world that lies outside the University. You are out to seek and make a career as an academician, administrator or an entrepreneur.</p>
		<p>You are like a ship ready to sail outward bound. Life is a voyage in the high seas. Your education and your degree is comparable to a set of charts. Your steering the ship is comparable to your skill to use this chart and knowledge. To seaworthy vessel, all oceans are open-If you have the skills and the chart, you can touch any port you. want-so in your life, with an ambition and plan, with adventurous spirit and skill, you can reach any high position.﻿</p>
		<p>No University can train you for an unknown situation but it can prepare you to face challenges with competence, confidence and courage. This implies, a degree is not an end in itself but only the beginning of a continuous learning process. It is learning to learn.' Learning never ends. Continuous learning gives you a feeling of self realisation, a sense of creativeness, a sense of responsibility, a knowledge of purpose and a fellowship with the world. This is development-development of the person-of the individual personality, developing the inherent resourcefulness, creativity, innovative ability, problem solving capability and productive capacity. Development is self competence, self-confidence and self-reliance, to stand on one's own legs and live with a sense of values of human dignity and, to become an asset and not a liability to the society. Self-reliance is the core of development and development is dependent on education. Self-reliance and gainful employment give a person dignity, increased incomes, reduce imbalances and increase the purchasing power of people.</p>
		<p>The aim of all development is the improvement of quality of life. Quality of life should include a satisfactory personal life, job satisfaction, a sense of community, a sense of social justice, a sense of belonging﻿ to one world with individual identity, equality and freedom.</p>
		<p>Life is worth living: Worth depends on values and values decide quality of life. We are what we value. That which we value moves us into action. Values are basically attitudes and a manifestation of behaviour. Values determine our choices and choices face us to examine our values.</p>
		<p>The focal value--that what society values most of the world today appears to be materialistic gain and conspicuous consumption, where 10% of the world consume 90% of the world's resources, resulting in depletion of resources, degradation of environment, domination and disparity, increasing inequity and inbuilt violence. indiscipline, indecision, inaction, corruption, craze for power and money have become a way of life. This value system must change and self-reliance should become the focal social value.</p>
		<p>Development should be with a social purpose, that requires transformation of social values and attitudes. What we need is a fresh thinking of life and living and the basic contours of a new life style for the mass of people. Development is a transdisciplinary process requiring a transdisciplinary approach. Leaders in philosophy, politics, sciences, économics, social﻿ sciences and others must join hands to outline alternative futuristics, formulate new patterns of thought and conduct and inspire new endeavours. It is not enough to merely direct the people towards good; they have to be provided with necessary motives for realising it. Otherwise, it would be like lighting an oil lamp without putting oil into it (Simone Weil). Free thinking men can be pioneers of progress. They should think out new ideals and fit them into realities of life in such a way that they influence most effectively the circumstances of the time (Schweitzer).</p>
		<p>As early as 1945, Gandhi wrote to Nehru " The real question according to you is how to bring about man's highest intellectual, economic, political and moral development. I agree. In this there should be an equal right and opportunity for all."</p>
		<p>Education is a vital input for the conception of values; inculcating right rational scientific attitudes; imparting knowledge, skills and awareness, leading to self competence, confidence and self reliance and gainful employment. This then is the link between education, employment and development.</p>
		<p>Education: Employment :</p>
		<p>Educational facilities in the country have expanded considerably in the past three﻿ decades. The number of educated persons entering labour market is on the increase but the employment opportunities have been limited. Thus by the beginning of 1980 there is a backlog of 3.7 million unemployed and to it another 8.1 mn is likely to be added during 1980-85. Of the total 12 mn unemployed, 2/3 are metriculates and the other 1/3(i.e.) 4 mn are graduates and post-graduates.</p>
		<p>This position is untenable. Special efforts are needed to correct this position. There are two obvious ways: (1) by reorientation of education and training, linking education with employment and (2) finding newer avenues for employment generation.</p>
		<p><em>Linkages :</em></p>
		<p>The Sixth Plan framework has called for concerted efforts to forge beneficial linkages between education, employment and development. This makes it necessary that the educational programs be related to emerging occupational patterns and also offer preemployment training as also continuing education for the already employed for their further improvement.</p>
		<p>Such a program includes restructuring of under-graduate course to make them purposeful and also terminal for those who seek employment, (2) provision for vocational courses and (3) making research relevant to national needs. This requires sensitization of the academic community, to the problems of poverty, unemployment, environmental pollution ; accepting public service as a primary function ; Extension Service as the third dimension in addition to training and research; transdisciplinary task forces approach to tackle a task; and legitimizing the involvement of academicians in development problems such as Minimum Needs program and the Health for All schemes. Experience with integrated Child Development Service has shown the beneficial impact of associating medical colleges with field program.</p>
		<p>At present most colleges have stereotyped, rigid curricula. They should be encouraged to have flexible curricula and also subject combinations which would improve employment opportunities and technical competence. eg. physics. mathematics and electronics or instrumentation or computer service : chemistry, biology and pharmacology or medical technology, etc. courses can be organised for careers in government services or in public enterprises, cooperative and small scale industry and in tertiary service sector like tourism and transport management. Such courses should simultaneously meet the employment needs of the educated and development needs of the country.﻿</p>
		<p><em>Employment Generation :</em></p>
		<p>The other avenues is greater employment generation. The Government has resorted to special employment programs from time. to time both at the state and national levels. *Some of these are programs for Half-aMillion jobs; Special Employment, for Educated unemployed; Self employment; Training of Engineers, Entrepreneural Development; Rural artisans/craftsmen, etc. The latest in the year 1979-80 are the National Scheme of Training of Rural Youth for self-employment for 0.2 mn youth every year; Honorarium or stipends to educated unemployed as done in Maharashtra, Karnataka, etc. Over Rs. 1,750 mn are spent on these various special programs. These programs aim at extension and improvement in the quality of education, experience, financial assistance, training in employment intensive and productive areas such as rural engineering services, door to door services like radio repairs ; agro service centres, extension of consumer co-operative stores ; design units for rural water supply, irrigation, floods and drought control, road and house building projects, district industries centres, etc.</p>
		<p>Most of the employment programs have training component either to orient the already trained people towards self-emplorment or to provide training in skills, manage﻿ment etc. required for self-employment. This only goes to prove probably the existing education does not prepare the student for 'any specific occupation or even group of occupations.</p>
		<p><em>Strategy:</em></p>
		<p>Reliefs, doles and stipends do not answer the unemployment problem. It would only aggrevate the tendency of dependence. The goal is self-reliance to make every person an asset and not a liability to the society. The answer is to mobilise, generate and utilise natural and human resources. To do this a resource inventory needs to be built indicating the country's strengths and making best use of them. Our strengths, to mention if only a few are-large trained and skilled manpower available at low cost; tropical climate a large country with a long coast line and rich traditional skills and experience. This gives us a clue. Greater employment may be generated in areas such as resource survey, generation and mobilisation, and setting up science, skill and resource based industries.</p>
		<p>Proper planning can be done only with a proper natural and human resource inventory. After a remote sensing survey, an army of educated unemployed could be gainfully processed into service for an inch﻿ to inch ground survey including botanists, zoologists, geologists, geographers, social scientists, statisticians, economists etc. Based on such a survey, land use maps, water-soilcrop management maps could be prepared and utilised with benefit.</p>
		<p>Taking advantage of tropical climate, resources may be generated in highly profitable areas like aromatic and medicinal plants ornamental plants like orchids, sericulture, mushrooms, economic and fast growing plants, biomass and algae for food or fuel; improved acquaculture for fish, prawns, muscles, setting up of model farms for breeding crocodiles, exotic and fur bearing animals etc. This would mean greater returns and additional employment.</p>
		<p>Resource mobilisation includes better. care and collection of oil seeds, gums, résins, tannins and other forest produce generating empolyment specially in tribal and hilly areas. Similarly manpower may be utilised with proper refresher or reorientation courses of the educated unemployed to meet industry's needs. The paradox is on one side a large number is waiting for a job and the industry is short of suitable people in several fields like marine geology, ocean engineering, polymer technology.</p>
		<p>Additional employment could be generated utilising the increased resources genera﻿ted and mobilized starting agro-forest, and animal based industries. For example, a phyto-chemical complex could be set up to extract perfumary components from lemon grass, citronella grass or jasmine and other flowers, oleoresins from ginger, turmeric cloves, chillies etc. bio-pesticides from pyrethrum flowers etc. fetching high returns and additional employment.</p>
		<p>Agro-industries may be established with the concept of utilising every part of the plant from leaf to the root. Take for example cotton plant, cotton leaves yield vitamin C., Cotton stalk for particle board, lintels for nitrocellulose, cotton for textiles, cotton seeds for edible oil, fatty acids, resins and for edible protein and finally cotton seed cake for fodder or fertilizer. Similarly several industries could be started around paddy plant. Paddy straw can be used for growing mushrooms; for fodder, thatched roof and for making straw board ; paddy husk for particle board, activated carbon, silicon and for ash to be made into cement; rice bran for edible oil, fatty acids and the residue as animal fodder; and rice for food, starcheş, chemicals and wine. At least 5-6 industries may be set up centred around each plant. This would mean bringing industries to rural areas where the bulk raw material is; fetching better returns to﻿ farmers; more gainful employment and bringing city comforts to the village, instead of bringing the villager to the City slums. Similarly, the vast resources of the ocean are yet to be fully tapped.</p>
		<p>One could also consider several science and skill based industries like solar and wind/ energy, electronics, chemicals; converting waste into wealth etc. We should be highly competitive as we have scientists in large numbers and they are paid much less as compared to advanced countries.</p>
		<p>Modern methods of management and technology could be woven into traditional tapestry to improve quality and productivity. Centralised management and decentralised production of consumer goods based on wood, leather, paper, food etc. would mean greater employment, traditional experience, skills, patience and precision as shown in gem cutting could be well utilised in making modern electronic and other precision components. I would like to think that such a strategy outlined above is likely to succeed in employment generation.</p>
		<p><em>Organisation :</em></p>
		<p>To implement such ideas, suitable organisation and methodology have to be evolved. Planning at Block and District level with a natural and human resources survey may﻿ be the first step. In the Sixth Plan, there is a proposal to set up a District Development Centre and District Employment Generation Council. There is already a. District Industries Centre. The development Centre should link education, employment and development and co-ordinate the activities of various state agencies like, Small Industries Corporation, Agro-industries Corporation etc. at the district level. The district plans should include, employment impact statements and employment audit. In providing financial credits and examining the feasibility reports, employment impact should be a criteria. Credit may be made available through the proposed National Agricultural Bank for Rural Development Bank (NABRD) and other development banks to meet the needs of the educated unemployed. In preparing plans and programmes, local development banks, industrialists, administrators, people's representatives, students and teachers may be involved. Involvement, consensus, harmony working together should be the pattern of our planning to ensure better implementation. Colleges may play their role in promoting self-employment ventures by educated persons and build linkage with the development departments and industry.</p>
		<p>Voluntary agencies such as Rotary﻿ Clubs may be involved in promoting such ventures.</p>
		<p>Development banks should encourage setting up and engage industrial consultancy firms to prepare a portfolio of projects to be offered to the entrepreneurs at the block and district levels.</p>
		<p>A well considered national policy may also be evolved for the export and import of talents getting Indian the right type of jobs abroad and making use of Indians abroad for starting trade and industries in India.</p>
		<p>On the lines of Peace Corps, a National Resources Corps may be set up to undertake various national tasks like resources survey. generation, mobilisation and utilisation ; preparation and implementation of plans, programmes and projects, technology transfer, consultancy and extension services; popularisation of science and scientific attitudes; and for making self-reliance as a mass movement stressing competence, character integrity, quality and excellence. National Resources Corps would then bring about a quiet revolution and become an instrument of social change.</p>
		<p>To-day, the nation faces a crisis of character, of courage, confidence and of purpose. Every crisis poses a challenge and every challenge an opportunity. Here is the opportunity for the educated youth to take﻿ up this challenge and change the course. I am sure you can do it. Only you can do it.</p>
		<p>My faith in the youth is more than confirmed by the letter I received from an young lady as I write this Lecture and I quote. " Youth is not a time of life it is a state of mind—a temper of the will, a quality of imagination and a vigor of the emotions, a freshness of the deep spring of life. Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity; of the appetite for adventure over a life of ease. Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear and despair those are the long long years that bow the head and turns the growing spirit back to dust whether sixty or sixteen. There should be in every educated person-a love of wonder, the sweet amazement of stars and star. like things and thoughts; the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing child like appetite for what comes next and the joy in the game of life.</p>
		<p>"You are as young as your faith and as old as your doubt; as young as your selfconfidence and as old as your fears; as young as your hope and as old as your despair.﻿</p>
		<p>"In the central place of your heart, there is a wireless station. So long as it receives messages of beauty, of hope, cheer, grandeur and courage and power from the earth, from people and from the infinite-so long you are young. When the wires are all down and the central places of your heart are covered with pessimism and ice of cynicism, then you have grown old indeed!”</p>
		<p>Such is the connection between youth and growth. May you all grow self-reliant with hope, courage, competence, confidence and character !﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY General K.V.K. RAO on Monday, 7th Dec. 1981<br />Mr Chancellor, Mr Vice Chancellor, Members<br />of the Senate, Ladies and Gentlemen,</h1>
		<p>1. I feel deeply honoured to have been. invited to deliver the Convocation Address to you, this year. I consider that this is something unique, as perhaps this is the first time that a soldier has been asked to do so. By this, I felt, that you have done the Armed Forces a great honour. My pleasure is all the greater, as an old and famous University such as yours, has asked me to undertake this task.</p>
		<p>2. Having been an Instructor at the National Defence Academy, indeed a founding member of the Institution, and having been an Instructor at the Defence Services Staff College ; as also having received a large number of young officers and men every year in the various Formations that I commanded, I have all along been deeply interested in the development of youth, whom I consider to be the future hope of this country. I have always been convinced that this great potential of the country should be properly nurtured and exploited for the good of the country.</p>
		<p>3. At the outset, I would like to congratulate all the young men and women who have received Degrees this evening and I wish them a very happy and prosperous future. I would also like to congratulate the members of the Faculty, who have made it possible for﻿ these young people to obtain their degrees. The knowledge that you have imbibed at the University is only the beginning and the foundation for your future career. On this, you will have to build up the expertise required for the career that you choose for yourself. Remember, the process of learning in life never stops.</p>
		<p>4. I realise that I have been invited here, not to put forth any views or give any advice in the academic field. You have enough experts for the purpose in the University and outside. I felt that my address should be more defence oriented. I am certain that nobody will deny that the subject of Defence is of vital importance to any country. Therefore, the bias of my address will be towards Defence; and I am sure that this is what you would want me to do.</p>
		<p>5. As you are no doubt aware, our country has been invaded several times, subjugated and ruled by alien conquerors. The main reasons for this were lack of unity, character, weakness in military capabilities, particularly, not keeping abreast with latest developments and technology and weak leadership. We had secured our freedom, not by a violent revolution, but by nonviolence and a civilised approach. It entailed à great deal of sacrifice, in particular by some of our great leaders like Mahatma﻿ Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. It is for us and the future generations to ensure that the independence and security of this great country are never again endangered. I am sure that you are also aware that after attaining Independence, we have had to fight four major wars that were thrust upon us. In these, it has been our proud privilege, that is, that of the Armed Forces, to make every sacrifice necessary for the successful defence of the country. We are a Nation wedded to the concept of Panchsheel', the five principles of peaceful co-existence; and would like to resolve any problems that we have with any country by peaceful methods and avoid resort to force. However, the international situation in general and the situation on our borders. in particular, is such that the threat to the Nation appears to be on the increase. Internally also, we are faced with several problems-economic, sociological and maintenance of law and order. The roles of the Armed Forces are to defend the country against external aggression and to provide aid to the civil authorities when called upon to do so. I know that the people place great reliance on the Armed Forces to do their duty towards the country. I wish to assure everybody that we shall live upto the confidence reposed in us by the Nation. We are ensuring that a high degree of combat effectiveness and﻿ operational preparedness are maintained at all times. We realise only too well that there is no 'Runners Up'in a war and that when it comes, we have got to win it. I wish to reiterate that we shall consider no sacrifice too great for upholding the honour and integrity of our Motherland.</p>
		<p>6. Clausewitz, a great military thinker and writer, said "War is a continuation of policy by other means." When nations fail to solve international disputes by diplomatic means, recourse is taken to the use of Armed Forces to obtain the solution. Modern war is complex and total, involving every branch of national life. All the resources of a Nation have to be geared up and all walks of life are involved, in the preparation for and the prosecution of war. A Nation at war is a team composed of the Government, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Para Military Forces, the Civil Services, the farmer, the industrial worker and the numerous others who play their seemingly smallest part in the life of the country. Experience of the past wars in the world has shown that the strength of a Nation is based on certain important factors, </p>
		<p>(a) The strength of the Armed Forces,not only in terms of numbers but also in terms of equipment, training, motivation and above all, leadership.</p> 
		<p>(b) National will and determination to﻿ see the war through to a successful conclusion, in other words, national morale.</p>
		<p>(c) Political stability, unity, character and discipline.</p>
		<p>(d) Economic stability and maximum possible self-sufficiency.</p>
		<p>(e) A high standard of science and technology.</p>
		<p>7. I would like to say a few words on each of these factors.</p> 
		<p>(a) Strength of the <em>Armed Forces.</em> The strength of the Armed Forces is determined by the commitments of the forces, by what is intended to be achieved, that is, war aims and objectives, and the strength of the adversaries. In our case, this is a matter that is constantly receiving the attention of the Chiefs of Staff and the Government. The importance of the man behind the gun cannot be over-stressed. Training of the Armed Forces to a high standard and providing them with effective leadership is very important. </p>
		<p>(b)<em> National Morale.</em> National morale cannot be built up over night. A war involves several sacrifices, not only during the war itself but during peace time as well. People must be prepared to lose their near and dear﻿ ones, property, put up with all types of discomforts and dangers, and yet, sustain the war effort. A belief in the basic principles and fundamental objectives of the Nation, righteousness of the cause and determination never to be subjugated, helps. People must be prepared to completely subordinate their interests to those of the Nation. In peace time, the Armed Forces have to be maintained at the requisite level to ensure that war is deterred if possible ; and that</p>
		<p>if deterrence fails, we win it.</p>
		<p>(c)<em> Political Stability.</em> I mentioned lack of unity as one of the main reasons for the several successful invasions of our country in the past. I hardly need emphasise that "Unity is Strength”. Political stability ensures the effective development and progress of the Nation. The need for character and discipline hardly require any elucidation, if a Nation is to move forward and be strong.</p>
		<p>(d)<em> Economic Stability.</em> Economic stability and political stability are interdependent. Self sufficiency in food and other essential requirements of the people, must be achieved. Judicious allocation of national resources to developmental programmes is﻿ essential. Production must be such that imports are restricted to the minimum essential. Exports should reach such a level that the foreign exchange position is sound. </p>
		<p>(e)<em> Science and Technology.</em> Science andTechnology play a very significant part in the development and defence effort of a Nation. In this connection, the need for original thinking and research, and indigenous production of our numerous requirements, hardly needs any stress. Obviously, we cannot always be assured of continued supplies of our requirements from abroad, as it became evident several times. New weapons and new equipment, which may turn the tide of the war, will have to be thought of and produced, sometimes during the war itself. All these require a high level of Science and Technology in the country.</p>
		<p> 8. You would have noticed by now how every citizen is affected, whether it is a question of preventing war in peace time by developing effective deterrence capability, or successfully waging a war, as and when it breaks out. In many countries, national service, whereby every able bodied citizen within the specified age group is required to serve in the Armed Forces, facilitates awareness of the defence requirements of the Nation. In our country, our Armed Forces are completely voluntary in nature. Perhaps national service in a modified manner could be introduced to a limited extent. Irrespective of this, the need for people taking interest in the defence of the country and contributing their mite, cannot be overemphasised. In this connection, I may mention that unfortunately, people see the Armed Forces mainly on ceremonials, during sports or at the most while in aid of civil power. Due to various reasons such as security, they do not get an opportunity to see the Armed Forces during war or even during training for war. Management of defence at various levels is not an easy affair; but requires considerable intellect, organisational ability, knowledge of contemporary warfare and leadership qualities of a high order. If any of you are joining the Armed Forces, I have no doubt that you will realise this very soon.</p>
		<p>9. Even if you do not join the Armed Forces, and irrespective of the walk of life that you choose for yourselves, as I said, many of you will be having something or the other to do with the defence effort of the Nation. Whether you are a civil servant, a manager of an industry, an engineer, a doctor, a farmer or whatever you may be, you may well be involved with defence. You add to﻿ the strength of the Nation by just doing your job well, no matter what it is.</p>
		<p>10. Many of you would have learnt the famous prayer from our scriptures</p>
		<p>" From untruth O Lord lead me to truth.<br />From darkness lead me to light.<br />From death lead me to immortality". </p>
		<p>The real aim of education is enlightenment. It may also bring immortality, if the enlightenment is geared towards the general good of the society. Education is not merely study of particular subjects, such as, literature or mathematics or sciences; but there is much more to it.' I feel that you would have fully benefitted by your education, if you have imbibed certain essential qualities that go to make you a good citizen, which in my opinion, are- </p>
		<p>(a) Patriotic spirit, which means, that you will be prepared to make any sacrifice for the honour and freedom of the Nation.</p>
		<p>(b) The belief that, irrespective of the State, religion, class or community that you belong to, you always consider yourself to be an Indian.</p>
		<p>(c) Service before self; in other words,you are prepared to subordinate your interests to those of the community or the organisation.</p>
		<p>(d) Pursuit of excellence, that is, never to be satisfied with sub-standard﻿ effort, either on your part or on the part of those who are under you. Nothing is impossible, provided you pursue your aims with determination and tenacity. Give off your best and then leave the rest to God, as enjoined in our scriptures. Whatever you want to achieve, do so in a correct and disciplined manner, in other words, do not forget constitutional methods and gentlemanly qualities.</p> 
		<p>11. I trust that my friends in the Faculty, would agree that education in the Country which does not include the objectives that I have mentioned, cannot be considered to be real and complete education. I may mention, with all the humility at my command, that in the Army, we are constantly striving to foster these qualities; and I consider, that whatever success we achieve, is largely due to these.</p>
		<p>12. We Indians, are generally a very critical lot of people. Perhaps this is a good thing, to keep everyone on his toes. However, I would like to say that before you criticize others, ask yourself whether you have given off your best to the Country. Have you done anything that has an adverse impact on the Nation ? Here, I would like to quote a famous US President--"Ask not﻿ what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."</p>
		<p>13. Finally, I thank you once again for inviting me over to this important function. I wish you all the very best and may God be with you.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY Dr. BALRAM JAKHAR<br />on Saturday, 22nd Jan. 1983<br />Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Members of the Senate, Ladies and Gentlemen</h1>	
		<p>I feel honoured to be here to deliver the Convocation address and to share my thoughts with you. This University has had the distinction of giving eminent scholars and educationists who have brought name and fame to the country. The glorious record and healthy traditions of dedicated service established by this great seat of learning, during nearly six and a half decades of its existence, makes the honour of participating in its Convocation, all the more greater.</p>
		<p>Let me, at the outset, offer my warm felicitations to all the young scholars who have been awarded the various degrees today. It is my earnest hope that in keeping with the fine traditions of this University, the young men and women who are leaving its portals' today, will always use their knowledge for the betterment of the poor and weaker sections of the society and humanity as a whole.</p>
		<p>My young friends, you are now stepping out into a wider field. While some of you may decide to continue with your higher academic pursuits, others may look for means of livelihood to settle down in life. In the prevailing milieu and the general socioeconomic conditions you have to develop a﻿ sense of adjustment in life because hope and despair are inseparable and unless we learn to live with the 'circumstances, our lives become miserable. Therefore, I would like you to face the complexities of life with supreme confidence and fortitude. When you tackle your problems with sincerity of purpose and perseverence, anything that you desire in life will not be unattainable. Every success should spur you on to attain greater heights and every failure should, likewise, fill you with renewed zeal and vigour to eventually reach your goal.</p>
		<p>I have no intention on this occasion to burden you with any sermons. I would only like to share with you my thinking on some of the problems which are exercising the minds of the people today.</p>
		<p>All of us are privileged to belong to a land with a rich and glorious past Our country is renowned for its inimitable feature of unity in diversity. We have here an infinite variety of religious faiths, cultural practices and social customs, of languages, food, dress and behaviour. As one travels from one end of the country to another and sees India in its manifold manifestations, all these differences fall into their proper place, revealing their essentially trivial nature and the country's inherent integrated pattern. Many are the common ideal and objectives which we share and amidst an apparent sea﻿ of diversity, there is a common bond which unifies us and that is, our heritage of being Indian.</p>
		<p>After a long and consistent struggle under the leadership of our great leaders like Lokmanya Tilak, Shri Gopal Krishan Gokhale, Mahatama Gandhi and Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru we achieved our independence from foreign rule nearly threeand-a-half decades ago. These great souls assiduously worked for the unity of our nation and infused in us a sense of brotherhood, fellowship and patriotism. It was only through a rare sense of unity shown by our people during these long years of struggle that we achieved independence.</p>
		<p>Young friends, you are fortunate enough to have been born in an independent country. Could you imagine the plight of those who suffered the pangs of slavery? Just think of the great heroes like Shaheed-e-Azam, Bhagat Singh, Shri Madan Lal Dhingra, Shri Ashfaq Uļla Khan, Shri Udham Singh and Shri Chander Shekhar Azad who sacrificed their lives for the motherland. What was the spirit behind all this? Selfiess dedication to a national cause. That missing link has to be revived to make the nation stronger and stronger.</p>
		<p>During our existence as a free nation, we have had to pass through times of trials, tribulations and turmoil and face difficulties﻿ of one kind or the other. We have had to cope with challenging situations such as those resulting from external aggression, natural calamities, domestic social and economic changes and enormous developmental tasks. If we have successfully met these challenges and surmounted our difficulties, it is only because of the unity and steadfastness displayed by our people, in moments of difficulty and grave crisis. These challenges and difficulties notwithstanding, India has made phenomenal progress in many directions, but the problems of growing popula-. tion, resultant unemployment, consequent poverty, malnutrition and hunger still defy solution and greatly hamper our progress and prosperity. When the population grows faster than the development of resources, it, is obvious that the minimum needs of the vast majority remain unfulfilled. The provisional results of the latest census operations have placed India's population at a staggering figure of 683 million which shows that during the last three decades about 322 million people have been added to our population. This has naturally affected every sector of our economy, more so the rural sector, where more than 75 per cent of our people live. Viewed in the eontext of the large additional requirements of food, clothing, housing and educational facilities, employment, etc., which the grow﻿ing numbers require, the effects of the significant economic development registered as a result of the implementation of the successive five year plans gets vastly neutralised and eventually have very little impact on the economy of the country. In the overall context of the country's development efforts, the highest priority is, therefore, to be accorded to the creation of an awareness among the people and securing their cooperation in making the population control programme a success. We cannot afford to be slow and sluggish in this matter of great concern. The voluntary organisations and the student community can play a very effective role in this direction and I expect my young friends to address themselves to this vital task by educating the people about the enormity of harm we are doing for posterity.</p>
		<p>Although I cannot claim to be an expert, yet I feel that education system needs to be overhauled. Greater importance and emphasis need to be given to the quality of education that is imparted by our educational institutions and the extent to which it helps in turning out young men and women with a greater sense of self fulfilment and dedication to national goals. There has been a phenomenal growth in the number of educational institutions and the rate of literacy has also recorded an upward trend but this﻿ is not enough to meet our requirements. Our educational system has to be clearly and consciously oriented to the national ethos and to the needs of our country's growth process. Without attempting to imitate blindly the experiments of the Western countries, our educational planners and administrators would do well to ensure that our educational institutions produce scholars and integrated personalities who are fairly well-rooted in India's composite culture and at the same time keep their windows open to allow fresh breeze to flow in freely from all directions. The whole philosophy of education should emphasize the training of independent and self-contained individuals capable of facing the problems and realities of life. This alone will fulfil the professed aims of education viz., producing good citizens with high character, scholarship, dedication and selfless service to the community, men imbued with wisdom, patriotism, self-confidence, high ideals and discipline,</p>
		<p>Education, as you know, is the foundation of developing society but there appears to be total chaos. The sanctity of examinations seems to be over due to mass copying and leakage of question papers with impurity. Established values are fast eroding. The educationists must give a serious thought to this aspect. Further, I feel that instead of creating a classless society, the present day﻿ education is creating different sets of people. The students who get education in public and convent schools--the privilege of the rich-- and those who get education in the Municipal and village schools, stand on different footing. The common student, thus, cannot catch up with the standards of public and convent schools. How can it be? The children who are getting sub-standard education in ordinary schools, when required to compete with their counterparts coming out from public and convent schools stand nowhere. Therefore, it is the duty of every good Government either to (a) provide facilities available in convent and public schools in ordinary schools or (b) take over all the convent and public schools for giving equal opportunities to the students to receive education there. But, for obvious reasons, these alternatives do not appear to be practicable. Therefore, the only reasonable solution can be that job availability in the administrative services and other spheres should be made proportionate according to the number of students coming out from convent/public schools and Government schools. A percentage could be fixed for each category and their merit and selection should be independent of each other. The students qualifying from convent/public schools could be absorbed in the number of vacancies set apart for them and the remaining vacancies﻿ could straight away go to the students coming from ordinary schools.</p>
		<p>In short, all available resources would have to be mobilized to rejuvenate our educational system for the benefit of the masses rather than for the elite sections of our society.</p>
		<p>In order to bring about a real socioeconomic transformation, I for one would like to advise our student community to strive to change the old order with its array of social and economic injustices, with its meaningless prejudices and superstitions, with its social stratification that hurts and obstructs development of our vast majority.</p>
		<p>The vital question before all of us today is what kind of India are we to bequeath to posterity-a strong, harmonious, self-confident or a faltering and weak India ? The answer is obvious but the task is onerous. The future of the nation is in the hands of our educated youth. You are our torchbearers and masters of tomorrow. It is for you to give serious thought as to how best you can contribute to serve the people and promote national outlook. It is my fervent prayer and hope that whatever your calling or station in life, you will always keep in mind your responsibilities as the citizens of this great country and with patriotic effort, fulfil your obligations for building a selfreliant, modern and progressive India.</p>
		<p>Thank you.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY R. VENKATARAMAN <br />on Thursday, 16th Feb. 1984<br />Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Ladies and<br /> Gentlemen and Graduates of the year</h1>
		<p>I feel privileged at your invitation to deliver the. Convocation Address at this University which has a glorious record of service extending over six decades and which has won renown as a great seat of learning. Mysore is a "city beautiful” and it symbolises the emerging India. As a princely State, it was a pioneer in irrigation, industrial development and power generation and after independence, Karnataka has made rapid progress in agriculture, defence and sophisticated industries and scientific and technological research. Farsighted statesmen like Visvesvarayya and Mirza Ismail had laid solid foundations for growth and their endeavours are in full blossom today.</p>
		<p>At the outset, I would like to congratulate all the graduates who have received their degrees and wish them a happy and prosperous future. It is my earnest hope that in keeping with the fine traditions of this University, the youngmen and women who are leaving its portals today, will strive to serve the Nation to the best of their ability informed by a spirit of dedication. The aim of University education is to make better men out of men and better citizens out of﻿ the common people. It behoves you, therefore, to think and act with responsibility, diligence and dignity. Many of you will seek employment in industries or Government. Many more will be self-employed in productive sectors of our economy. In whatever walk of life you may be engaged in, I trust you will not lose sight of the perspective, the pursuit of excellence. By conscious application of skill and disciplined pursuit of goals, you will not only be serving your personal interest but also the national cause of productivity and prosperity.</p>
		<p>Scientific inventions followed by Industrial Revolution had transformed medieval societies into prosperous nations. Unfortunately, Industrial Revolution bypassed the countries of Asia and Africa which were under colonial domination during those critical days and practically left them in a medieval state. It is only after the transfer of power that the newly emerging nations took to the path of scientific, technological and industrial development starting with a handicap of over two centuries. This, however, need not deter faster growth of developing countries. Fortunately, Science is impersonal. It is not moved by heed or appeal. It does not treat laboratories of developing countries any better or worse than a rich laboratory. If developing countries acquire capability to﻿ absorb current technology and embark on innovation and improvement on the technology acquired, they can even march ahead of developed countries. It is indeed a waste of time, effort and money to attempt to rediscover scientific and technological developments known to the world. It is far wiser to acquire current technology and concentrate effort on innovative work on it, so that a •steady stream of self-reliance is built up. Mere acquisition of every improvement in technology, without indigenous effort at upgrading it, will only result in abject dependence on import which will bleed the country white. The Technology Policy Statement of the Government of India clearly declares that science and technology is the basis of economic progress; it recognises that we have a strong agricultural and industrial base and a scientific man-power 'impressive in quality, numbers and range of skills. Given clearcut objectives and necessary support, our science also has shown its capacity to solve problems. The Technology Policy Statement categorically asserts that "Our future depends on our ability to resist the imposition of technology which is obsolete or unrelated to our specific requirements and policies which tie us to systems which serve the purposes of others rather than our own."</p>
		<p>It is the habit of nature to conceal its riches and yield its graces only to those﻿ who arduously labour for its denouement. It is impossible to predict with any amount of certainty what discoveries or inventions in Science are going to be in the current decade. Nobody predicted the invention of the transister or laser or xerox process a few decades back. Until Science discovered the minerals, ores were no more than filthy clay or rubble. Man has turned many a waste into wealth by sheer intelligence and endeavour. It is said that not a grain of sand lies in the beach but infinite knowledge knows how to utilise it. Humanity is marching towards attainment of that. infinite knowledge and India cannot retreat from the march, if she wishes to increase the national wealth and improve the standard of life of the people. The Kothari Commission on Education pointed out that Universities have to provide the right kind of leadership in all walks of life, to identify gifted youth and help them develop that potential fully. It is the duty of our Universities to produce among the thousands of graduates a handful of gifted youth as envisaged by the Commission on Education. While our Universities and colleges mass produce average quality graduates, they do not go all out to seek talent and develop it. In fact, a genius with talent in one specialisation may not even qualify for a degree in our Universities because he does not make the grade in the other compulsory subjects. There is too much rigidity in the curricula that one is denied opportunity to study a combination of subjects of one's choice. There is no reason why a student should not be allowed to study a combination of subjects, such as, literature, psychology, electronics and computer technology. Such options are available in many western Universities and I do not think that any of those graduates are worse off for it. I understand that a few institutions in India have introduced this concept and I hope it will become more and more widespread.</p>
		<p>Indeed we are living through historic times. We have transformed a backward benighted agricultural India that it was prior to independence, into a modern tenth industrialised nation in the world. Thanks to the vision and foresight of Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, heavy industries like steel, coal, aluminium and copper were started on a massive scale through the successive Five Year Plans. Crude oil production will touch 26 million tons in 1983-84 while installed capacity for power generation will reach 42,000 MW at the end of this Plan. The manufacture of engineering goods, fertilisers, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and consumer durables followed as a corollary to the establishment of basic industries and the development of infrastructure. Thus, industrial economy has strikingly diversified ; manufacturing﻿ capabilities extend over a wide range of products and have acquired adaptability for designs, structurals and machine tools. I can state with confidence that the industrial economy has reached the take off stage.</p>
		<p>I have somewhat laboured this point to impress on you that we have every reason to congratulate ourselves on our growth and development. It has become the fashion among seeming intellectuals to denigrate ourselves and destroy the self confidence so necessary for adventure. While I will not be euphoric on our progress, I cannot accept the ill-informed criticism that detracts the past achievements and undermines future national effort. Viewed in the proper perspective, our achievements should spur us towards higher goals and not lull us into complacency. I should like to recall the famous lines of Robert Browning.</p>
		<p>"That a man's reach should exceed his grasp or else what is a Heaven for."</p>
		<p>National progress will be meaningful only to the extent that it improves the standard of living of the weaker sections of the society. If scientific and technological developments are not translated into schemes for the relief of the vulnerable sections of society, these very developments will soon get discredited. A deprived people will turn into a desperate people and the peaceful﻿ evolution of society will then become a casualty. Thus, confining the fruits of development to certain regions or certain classes constitutes a threat to society. We have. managed to inject scientific agricultural methods in a rigidly traditional area and to introduce mechanised small scale units in the place of traditional cottage industries. We have made massive investments through successive Five Year Plans but all these have not mitigated the gigantic problem of unemployment and under-employment. Nor have they made noticeable impact on the volume of persons below the poverty line. One of the reasons, for this sorry state of affairs is the unbridled growth of population. From about 320 million people three decades ago, the population of India has increased to around 700 million today. Besides, the rate of growth of population among the vulnerable sections of society is disproportionately larger than in the middle and affluent classes, thereby accentuating the increase of people below the poverty line. There is an urgent. need, therefore, among the educated people not only to practice population control but create a climate for its acceptance among those amidst whom they live.</p>
		<p>I had stated earlier that one of the aims of a University is to make better citizens out of the common people. Virtues like tolerance, discipline, punctuality and law abidance﻿ cannot be developed overnight but must be cultivated from a very early age in the schools and colleges. True democracy rests on voluntary observance of the laws of the land and not on enforcement thereof by force. Indeed the history of civilisation is nothing more than the history of human endeavour to tame the primeval instincts of man and make him live in peace and harmony with his fellow men. If University education teaches one patriotism to sacrifice everything for the freedom and honour of the motherland, humanism to regard every person, irrespective of religion, caste or creed as a brother, discipline to perform one's duty to one's own satisfaction, it would have rendered service to its alumni.</p>
		<p>What distinguishes the youth from the old is the outlook on life. It is the habit of the old to look at the setting Sun and bemoan the day that had passed while the youth looks at the rising Sun, ever hoping, ever believing that the brighter day is before it. It is with this confidence I want you all graduates to start on your career with my best wishes for your success.﻿</p>

		<p>ಈ ದಿನ ನಮ್ಮೆಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ಹರ್ಷದ ದಿನ, ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಒಂದು ಹಬ್ಬದ ದಿನ. ಪದವೀಧರರಿಗೆ, ಸಾಹಸದಿಂದ ಸಾಗರ ದಾಟಿ, ದಡ ಸೇರಿದ ಆತ್ಮ ಸಮಾಧಾನದ ದಿನ, ಇಂತಹ ಈ ಸಮಾರಂಭದಲ್ಲಿ ತಮ್ಮೆಲ್ಲರೊಡನೆ ಬೆರೆಯಲು ಅವಕಾಶ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಟ್ಟ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಕುಲಪತಿಗಳಿಗೆ ನಾನು ತುಂಬಾ ಆಭಾರಿ,</p>
		<p>ಈ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯವನ್ನು ಬೆಳಸಿ, ಬೆಳಗಿಸಿದ, ಬೆಳಸುತ್ತಿರುವ ಹಿಂದಿನ ಹಾಗೂ ಈಗಿನ ಕುಲಪತಿಗಳಿಗೂ, ಪ್ರಾಧ್ಯಾಪಕ ವರ್ಗಕ್ಕೂ ಹಾಗೂ ಈ ಬೆಳವಣಿಗೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಕಾರಣವಾದ ಉಳಿದ ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ನಾನು ತುಂಬು ಹೃದಯ ದಿಂದ ಅಭಿನಂದಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ. ಅದರಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಈ ವರ್ಷ ಪದವಿಗಳನ್ನು ಪಡೆದು ಹರ್ಷದಿಂದ ಹೊರ ಬರುತ್ತಿರುವ ಎಲ್ಲ ಪದವೀಧರರಿಗೂ ನನ್ನ ಹಾರ್ದಿಕ ಶುಭಾಶಯಗಳು; ಹಾಗೂ ತಮ್ಮತಮ್ಮ ವಿಷಯಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಶಸ್ತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಪಡೆದ ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ನನ್ನ ಅಭಿನಂದನೆಗಳು. ಅವರೆಲ್ಲರ ಭವಿಷ್ಯ ತುಂಬ ಉಜ್ವಲ ವಾಗಲೆಂದು ನಾನು ಹಾರೈಸುತ್ತೇನೆ.</p>
		<p>ಮೈಸೂರು ಮಹಾ ನಗರ, ಕನ್ನಡ ನಾಡಿನ ಕಣ್ಮಣಿ, ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ಸಾಗರ. ಅದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ನನಗೆ ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಆದರ, ಈ ಮಹಾನಗರ ಕನ್ನಡ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ತವರು ಮನೆ. ಇದು ಒಂದು ಪರಿಶುದ್ಧ, ಪವಿತ್ರ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರವಾಗಿಯೇ ಉಳಿಯಬೇಕೆಂಬುದು ನನ್ನ ಹಿರಿಯ ಆಸೆ,﻿ ಆಧುನಿಕ ಔದ್ಯೋಗೀಕರಣದ ಹೊಗೆ ತುಂಬಿಕೊಂಡು ಬೂದಿ ಹರಡಿಕೊಂಡು, ಇದರ ಪರಿಸರವನ್ನು ಹಾಳು ಮಾಡದಂತೆ ನೋಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳುವ ಎಚ್ಚರಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ನಾವೆಲ್ಲರೂ ವಹಿಸಬೇಕು. ಆರ್ಥಿಕ, ಶೈಕ್ಷಣಿಕ ಹಾಗೂ ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ ಈ ನಗರದ ನೈರ್ಮಲ್ಯ ನಿರಂತರ ಉಳಿಯಲೆಂದು ಹಾರೈಸುತ್ತೇನೆ.</p>
		<p>ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಈಗ ನೂರಕ್ಕೂ ಮೇಲ್ಪಟ್ಟು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಗಳು, ಸುಮಾರು ಐದು ಸಾವಿರಕ್ಕೂ ಮೇಲ್ಪಟ್ಟು ಕಾಲೇಜುಗಳು ಇವೆ. ಇಂದು 'ನಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿ ಅತಿ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನಿಗಳು ತಂತ್ರಜ್ಞರು ಇದ್ದಾರೆ. ಇದು ನಿಜವಾಗಿಯೂ ಹೆಮ್ಮೆಯ ವಿಷಯ. ಹೀಗಿದ್ದರೂ ನಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿ ಮೂರು ದಶಲಕ್ಷ ಜನ ಇನ್ನೂವರೆಗೆ ನಿರಕ್ಷರಿಗಳಾಗಿರುವುದನ್ನು ನಾವು ಕಾಣುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇವೆ. ಅವರೆಲ್ಲರೂ ನಮ್ಮ ಜನತೆಯ ದುರ್ಬಲ ವರ್ಗಗಳಿಗೆ ಸೇರಿದವರು. ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಹಾಗೂ ಆರ್ಥಿಕ ಅನಿವಾರಗಳಿಂದಾಗಿ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣಾವಾಕಾಶಗಳ ಲಾಭವನ್ನು ಪಡೆಯಲು ಅವರು ಅಸಮರ್ಥರಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಮಕ್ಕಳೆಂಬುವರೆಲ್ಲರೂ ತಂದೆ ತಾಯಿಗಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ಹೊರಗಡೆ ದುಡಿದು ಕುಟುಂಬದ ಆದಾಯಕ್ಕೆ ಸಲ್ಲಿಸ ಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಸರ್ಕಾರವು, ಸಮಾಜವು, ಈ ಸಂಗತಿಯನ್ನು ಗಮನಿಸಿ, ಇಂತಹ ಸೌಲಭ್ಯವನ್ನು ನಿರ್ಗತಿಕ ವರ್ಗಗಳವರಿಗೂ, ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಪಡೆಯಬೇಕಾದ ಮೂಲ ಭೂತ ಅನುಭೋಗದಿಂದ ವಂಚಿತರಾಗಿರತಕ್ಕಂತಹವರಿಗೂ ಕಲ್ಪಿಸಿಕೊಡಬೇಕು.</p>
		<p>ಯಾವಾಗಲೂ ಹೊಸಹೊಸ ಶಾಲೆಗಳನ್ನು ತೆರೆಯುವ ಬೇಡಿಕೆಗಳು ದಿನೇದಿನೇ ಬೆಳೆಯುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಆದರೆ, ನಮ್ಮ ಆರ್ಥಿಕ ಮೂಲಗಳು ಬಹಳಷ್ಟು ಷರಾಜಿತವಾಗಿರುವುದು ಅಷ್ಟೇ ನಿಜ. ಅಂತಹದರಲ್ಲಿಯೂ, ಸ್ಥಳೀಯ ಜನತೆಗೆ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಸೌಲಭ್ಯ ಇಲ್ಲದೆಡೆಯಲ್ಲಿಯೇ ಇಂತಹ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳನ್ನು ಆರಂಭಿಸಲು ಎಡೆ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಡುವ ಕ್ರಮ ಪ್ರಾಪ್ತವಾಗಿದೆ. ದುರ್ಬಲ ವರ್ಗದ ಮಕ್ಕಳು ಇತ್ತೀಚೆಗೆತಾನೆ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣಕ್ಕೆ ಕರೆದುಕೊಂಡಿರುವುದರಿಂದ ಹಾಗೂ ಮೊದಲ ತಲೆಮಾರಿನ ಗಳಿಕೆಯವರಾಗಿರುವುದರಿಂದ, ಈ ವರ್ಗಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಗತಿ ಅಷ್ಟೊಂದು ಕಂಡು ಬರದಿದ್ದರೂ ಶಿಕ್ಷಕರಾದವರು ಅವರಿಗೆ ವಿಶೇಷ ಲಕ್ಷ ಪೂರೈಸಿ ನೆರವು ನೀಡಬೇಕು. ಶಿಕ್ಷಕರ ಯೋಗ್ಯತೆಯನ್ನು ಅವರು ತಮ್ಮ ಅಧ್ಯಾಪನದ﻿ ಅವಧಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಎಷ್ಟು ಜನ ಹಿಂದುಳಿದ ಮಕ್ಕಳನ್ನು ಮುನ್ನಡೆಸುವುದರಲ್ಲಿ ಯಶಸ್ವಿಯಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ ಎಂಬುದರ ಮೇಲೆಯೇ ನಿರ್ಧರಿಸಬೇಕು.</p>
		<p>ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳ ನಿರ್ವಹಣೆಯನ್ನು ಸರ್ಕಾರ ಕೈ ಗೊಂಡಂತೆ, ಈ ದಿಶೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಮ್ಮ ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಹೊಣೆಗಾರಿಕೆ ಹೆಚ್ಚ ಬೇಕಾದುದೂ ಅತ್ಯಗತ್ಯ. ವಿದ್ಯಾ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳನ್ನು ಸಮಾಜದ ಅವಿಭಾಜ್ಯ ಅಂಗವಾಗಿ ನೋಡಬೇಕೇ ವಿನಾ ಪ್ರತ್ಯೇಕತೆಯ ಭಾವದಿಂದಲ್ಲ. ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾದಷ್ಟೂ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ದೃಷ್ಟಿಯನ್ನು ಬೆಳೆಸಿಕೊಂಡು ವಿದ್ಯಾಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಜನತೆಯ ಪಾಲುಗಾರಿಕೆಗೆ ಎಡೆ ಮಾಡಿ, ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವನ್ನು ಉದ್ದೇಶಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿಸಬಹುದು. ಹೊಣೆಯರಿತವರಾದ ಶಿಕ್ಷಕರು ಅಶಿಕ್ಷಿತರನ್ನು ಗೌರವಯೋಗ್ಯರಾಗುವಂತೆ ಮಾಡಬಹುದು. ಹಾಗೂ ಅನ್ನೋನ್ಯ, ಸೌಹಾರ್ದ ಸಾಧಿಸಬಹುದು. ಶಾಲೆ ಎಂಬುದು ಜನತೆಯ ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಹಾಗೂ ಸಾಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಕ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ದಿಯ. ಚಟುವಟಿಕೆಯ ಕೇಂದ್ರವಾಗಬೇಕು, ಅಲ್ಲಿ ಊರಿನ ಜನ ತಮ್ಮ ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಹಾಗೂ ಸಾಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಕ ಕಾರ್ಯಕ್ರಮಗಳಿಗೆ ಆಗಾಗ್ಗೆ ನೆರವಾಗಬೇಕು. ಶಾಲೆಗೆ ಅಗತ್ಯವಾದ ಸಾಮಗ್ರಿಗಳನ್ನು ಒದಗಿಸಲು ತಯಾರಿರಬೇಕು. ಹೀಗೆ ಹಲವು ಬಗೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ವಿದ್ಯಾಸಂಸ್ಥೆ ಹಾಗೂ ಜನತೆ ತತ್ಸಂಬಂಧಿಗಳಾಗಿ ಬೆಳೆಯಬೇಕು.</p>
		<p>ಇಂದು ಈ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯದಿಂದ ಹೊರ ಬೀಳುವ ಪದವೀಧರರು ಉದೋಗ ಶೋಧನೆಗೆ ಹೊರಡುವವರೆ ಆಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ, ಎನ್ನುವ ಅರಿವು ನನಗಿದೆ. ನಿರುದ್ಯೋಗವು ಭೂತಾಕಾರವಾಗಿ ಈಗಾಗಲೇ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಮನದ ಎದುರಿಗೆ ನಿಂತಿರ ಬೇಕು. ಅನೇಕ ಜನ ಬಡ ಪಾಲಕರು ತಮ್ಮ ಬದುಕಿನ ಅಗತ್ಯಗಳನ್ನು ತ್ಯಾಗಮಾಡಿ, ತಮ್ಮ ಮಕ್ಕಳನ್ನು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಕಳುಹಿಸಿಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಅವರೆಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ಒಂದೊಂದೇ ಆಸೆ ! ತಮ್ಮ ಮಕ್ಕಳು ಬೇಗನೆ ಒಂದು ಲಾಭ ದಾಯಕ ನೌಕರಿಗೆ ಹಚ್ಚಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು ! ಆದರೆ, ಅವರಲ್ಲಿ ಹಲವರಿಗೆ ಭ್ರಮ ನಿರಸನವೂ ಹತಾಶೆಯೂ ಕಾದಿದೆ !</p>
		<p>ಇಂದಿನ ಕಾಲಕ್ಕೆ ತಕ್ಕಂತೆ, ಮನುಷ್ಯರ ಶಕ್ತಿ ಹಾಗೂ ಶೈಕ್ಷಣಿಕ ಅವಕಾಶಗಳಿಗೆ ಸಂಬಂಧಿಸಿದಂತೆ ಸೂಕ್ತ ಯೋಜನೆಗಳು ಅವಶ್ಯ. ಸ್ವಯಂ﻿ ಉದ್ಯೋಗ ಸಾಮರ್ಥ, ಸನ್ನಡತೆಗಳು ಉಂಟಾಗುವಂತೆ ಇಂದಿನ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ವಿಧಾನಕ್ಕೆ ಹೊಸ ತಿರುವು ನೀಡಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಸರ್ಕಾರದ ಆಡಳಿತ ವರ್ಗ, ಅದರಂತೆ ಪ್ರಾಧ್ಯಾಪಕ ವರ್ಗವೂ ಯೋಗ್ಯ ಉದ್ಯೋಗಾವಕಾಶಗಳನ್ನು ಒದಗಿಸುವ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಗಮನಿಸಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಉದ್ಯೋಗದ ಅವಕಾಶಗಳಿಗೆ ಅತ್ಯಗತ್ಯ ವಾದ ಅರ್ಹತೆಯ ಮಟ್ಟವನ್ನೂ, ಒದಗಿಸಬೇಕಾದ ವೈಜ್ಞಾನಿಕ-ಪ್ರಾಯೋಗಿಕ ವಿಧಾನಗಳನ್ನೂ, ಬೋಧನೆಗಳ ಹಾಗೂ ಬೋಧಕರ ತರಬೇತಿ ಕ್ರಮಗಳನ್ನೂ ಯೋಜಿಸಬೇಕಾಗುತ್ತದೆ.</p>
		<p>ಭಾರತೀಯ ಜನಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಅರ್ಧಕ್ಕಿಂತ ಮೇಲಾಗಿ ಮಹಿಳೆಯರಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಯತ್ರ ನಾರೀ ಪೂಜ್ಯತೇ ರಮಂತೇ ತತ್ರ ದೇವಾಃ " ಎಂಬುದು ಭಾರತೀಯ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿ, ಸ್ತ್ರೀ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣದ ಪ್ರಗತಿ ಸಾಧಿಸದೆ ಸಮಾಜ ಸುಧಾರಣೆ ಆಗಲಾರದು. ಮಹಿಳಾ ಉದ್ದಾರದ ಕಾರ್ಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣದ ಪ್ರಗತಿ ಪಥದಲ್ಲಿ ಮಾತ್ರವೆ ಸಾಗಬೇಕು. ಈಗಿರುವ 70 ಕೋಟಿ ಜನ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆ ಇನ್ನೂ ಬೆಳೆಯುತ್ತಾ ಹೋಗಿ ಅದು ಹೊರಲಾರದ ಭಾರವಾದರೆ ಭಾರತದ ಭವಿಷ್ಯ ತುಂಬಾ ನಿರಾಶಾದಾಯಕ ವಾದುದಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಶಿಕ್ಷಿತ ಮಹಿಳೆಯರು ಈ ಭಾರವನ್ನು ಬಹು ಪಾಲು ಭಾಗ ಕಡಿಮೆ ಮಾಡಿ, ಭಾರತೋದ್ದಾರಕ್ಕೆ ಸಕ್ರಿಯ ಸಹಾಯ ಮಾಡುವುದು ಒಳ್ಳೆಯದು.</p>
		<p>ನಾವೀಗ ನಮ್ಮ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಪದ್ಧತಿಯನ್ನು ಮೂಲಭೂತವಾಗಿ ಮಾರ್ಪಾಡು ಮಾಡುವ ದಾರಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಇದ್ದೇವೆ. ಬ್ರಿಟಿಷರು ಬೆಳೆಸಿಬಿಟ್ಟ ಪದ್ಧತಿಯನ್ನು ಬೇಕಾದ ಹಾಗೆ, ತಿದ್ದಿ, ಬಳಸುತ್ತಾ ಬಂದಿದ್ದೇವೆ. ಆದರೆ, ಈಗ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನದ ಮುನ್ನಡೆಯಿಂದಾಗಿ, ಹಾಗೂ ಸ್ವದೇಶೀಯ ಜಾಯಮಾನಕ್ಕೆ ಇದು ಸಂಪೂರ್ಣ ವಾಗಿ ಸರಿ ಹೋಗದಿರುವುದರಿಂದಾಗಿ ನಮ್ಮೆಲ್ಲರ ಆಶೆ ಆಕಾಂಕ್ಷೆಗಳನ್ನೂ ಈಡೇರಿಸಲು ಈ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಕ್ರಮವನ್ನು ಬದಲಾವಣೆಗೊಳಿಸಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಸ್ವಾವಲಂಬಿಗಳಾಗಬೇಕಾಗಿದ್ದ ನಮ್ಮ ವಿದ್ಯಾವಂತರು, ಪದವೀಧರರು, ಪರಾವಲಂಬಿ ಆಗುವ ಸ್ಥಿತಿ ಬೆಳೆಯುತ್ತಿದೆ, ವಿದ್ಯಾಭ್ಯಾಸ ಕೇವಲ ಸರ್ಕಾರಿ ನೌಕರಿಗೆ ರಹದಾರಿ ಎಂಬ ಭಾವನೆ, ಸ್ವಾವಲಂಬನ ದಾರಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾಗಿರುವ﻿ ಭಾರತದ ಭವಿಷ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ಸರಿಯೆ ? ಪದವಿಗೂ ನೌಕರಿಗೂ ಇರುವ ಕೊಂಡಿಯನ್ನು ಉಳಿಸಬೇಕೆ, ಕಳಚಬೇಕೆ ? ಇಲ್ಲವೇ ಸಡಿಲಿಸಬೇಕೆ ? ಹಾಗಾದರೆ, ಪದವಿಗಳ ಅಗತ್ಯವೇನು ? ಈ ಪದವೀ ಸಮಾರಂಭಗಳ ಆವಶ್ಯಕತೆ ಏನು ? ಎಂಬ ಮೂಥಿ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗಳು, ಶಿಕ್ಷಣತಜ್ಞರು ಸಮಾಜ ಪರಿವರ್ತಕರು ಹಾಗೂ ಸರ್ಕಾರವೂ ಬಿಡಿಸಬೇಕಾದ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆ.</p>
		<p>ಪ್ರಾಥಮಿಕ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣದಿಂದಲೇ ವೃತ್ತಿ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ನೀಡಬೇಕಾದುದು ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಆವಶ್ಯಕ. ಆದರೆ ಅವರವರಿಗೆ ಅವರವರ ವೃತ್ತಿಶಿಕ್ಷಣವನ್ನು ನೀಡುವ ಮೂಲಕವಾಗಿ ಆಯಾ ವೃತ್ತಿಪರರನ್ನು ಆಯಾ ವೃತ್ತಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿಯೇ ಆಳವಾಗಿ ಬೇರು ಬಿಡಿಸಿದಂತಾದೀತು, ಎನ್ನುವ ಭಯವೂ ಪ್ರಾಥಮಿಕ ಮಟ್ಟದ ವೃತ್ತಿ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣದ ಬಗೆಗೆ ಕೆಲವರಲ್ಲಿದ್ದರೆ ತಪ್ಪಲ್ಲ. ವೃತ್ತಿಗಳಮೇಲೆ ಜಾತಿಗಳು ಹುಟ್ಟಿ ಕೊಂಡ ಈ ನಾಡಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಜಾತಿಯ ಸಂಕೋಲೆಯಿಂದ ಮುಕ್ತರಾಗಿ ಹೊರಬರಲು ಹೇಗೆ ಸಾಧ್ಯ? ಉದಾರ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವನ್ನು ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯವಾಗಿ ಎಲ್ಲ ವೃತ್ತಿಯವರಿಗೂ ಎಲ್ಲ ವರ್ಗದವರಿಗೂ ಕಡ್ಡಾಯವಾಗಿ ನೀಡಲೇಬೇಕು. ಅವರವರ ಜಾತಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಮುಳುಗಿಸದಂತಹ ವೃತ್ತಿ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವನ್ನು ಉತ್ಪಾದಕವಾಗುವಂತೆ ಜಾಗ್ರತೆವಹಿಸಿ, ನೀಡಿ, ಯಾರೂ ಜಾತಿಯ ಕೆಸರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಬೀಳದಂತೆ ನೋಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳಬೇಕು.</p>
		<p>ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯದ ಓದು ಇನ್ನೂ ನೂರಕ್ಕೆ ಒಬ್ಬರಿಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಲಭಿಸುವಂತಹ ಮಹಾ ಯೋಗವಾಗಿದೆ. ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರದ ಜನಸಂಖ್ಯೆಯ ಅರ್ಧಕ್ಕಿಂತಲೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಜನರಿಗೆ ಅಕ್ಷರಜ್ಞಾನವೂ ಎಟುಕದ ಕೈಲಾಸವಾಗಿದೆ. ಈ ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ಓದು ಬರಹ ನೀಡುವ ಬಗೆ ಹೇಗೆ ? ಗಂಗೆ, ಯಮುನೆ, ಕೃಷ್ಣ, ಕಾವೇರಿಯರು ಹರಿದು, ಹರಸಿದ ಈ ನಾಡಿನಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಬರಗಾಲ ಇರುವಂತೆ, ನೂರಾರು ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಗಳು ಇನ್ನೂ ಕೋಟ್ಯಂತರ ಜನ ನಿರಕ್ಷೆರರಾಗಿಯೇ ಉಳಿದಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ನದಿನದಿಗಳನ್ನೆಲ್ಲ ಕೂಡಿಸಿ, ನಾಡನ್ನೆಲ್ಲ ಜಲಸಂಪನ್ನವಾಗಿ ಬೆಳಸಿ, ಪೈರುಪಟ್ಟೆ ಯಿಂದಾಗಿ ಫಲವತ್ತಾಗಿ ಮಾಡುವ ಒಂದು ಮಹಾಸ್ವಪ್ನವು ನನಗೆ ಇದೆ. ಅದರಂತೆ, ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಗಳಲ್ಲೆಲ್ಲಾ ಓದಿ ಹೊರಬಂದ ವಿದ್ಯಾವಂತರು﻿ ನಿರಕ್ಷರರಿಗೆ ಓದು ಬರಹ ನೀಡುವ ಮಹಾ ಸಾಹಸಕ್ಕೆ ತೊಡಗಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರವು ರೂಪಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿರುವ ಈಗಿನ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ನೀತಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಾಥಮಿಕ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣಕ್ಕೆ ಪ್ರಾಧಾನ್ಯ ಇದೆ. ಎಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ಆರೋಗ್ಯದ ಅರಿವನ್ನೂ, ಅಕ್ಷರ ಜ್ಞಾನವನ್ನೂ ನೀಡುವ ಹೊಣೆ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರದ್ದಾಗಿದೆ. ಹಳೆಯ ಜಾಡಿನಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆದು ಬಂದ ಮನಸ್ಸಿಗೆ ಈ ಹೊಸ ಉದಾರ ದೃಷ್ಟಿಯು ವಿಶ್ವಾಮಿತ್ರನ ನವಸೃಷ್ಟಿ ಎಂದೆನಿಸಬಹುದು,</p>
		<p>ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಸಮತೆ, ಸಮಭಾವ ಹಾಗೂ ಆರ್ಥಿಕ ಅಭಿವೃದ್ಧಿ ಇವು ದೇಶದ ಪ್ರಗತಿಯ ಅಡಿಪಾಯಗಳು, ಇವಕ್ಕೆ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವೇ ವಜ್ರವೇದಿಕೆ. ಇದಕ್ಕೆ ಮುಂಬಲ ಬೆಂಬಲವಾಗಿ ಕಾಠ್ಯಕ್ರಮವನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸಿ ಮುಂದೆ ಹೋಗುವ ಮನಃಪರಿವರ್ತನೆಯು ಸಮಾಜದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾದರೆ, ಸರ್ವೊದಯದ ದಾರಿ ಸುಗಮವಾಗುವುದು. ಅರ್ಹರಿಗೆ ಮಾತ್ರ ಉನ್ನತ ವ್ಯಾಸಂಗ ಎಂಬುದು ಸರಿಯೆನಿಸಿದರೂ, ಅರ್ಹರು ಯಾರು ಎಂಬ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆ ಏಳುತ್ತದೆ. ಮೇಲು ನೋಟಕ್ಕೆ ಸರಿಯೆನ್ನಿಸುವ ಅರ್ಹತಾ ಸಿದ್ಧಾಂತವನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟುನಿಟ್ಟಾಗಿ ಒಪ್ಪಿದ್ದರೆ, ಈಗ ನಾಡಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರತಿಭಾವಂತರೆನ್ನಿಸಿಕೊಂಡಿರುವ ಎಷ್ಟೋಜನ ಅಶಿಕ್ಷಿತರಾಗಿಯೆ ಉಳಿದಿರಬೇಕಾಗಿದ್ದಿತು. ಏಕಲವ್ಯನಿಗೆ ಧನುರ್ವಿದ್ಯೆಯನ್ನು ನೀಡಲು ಒಪ್ಪದ ವರಿದ್ದ ಈ ನಾಡಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಉನ್ನತ ವಿದ್ಯೆಗೆ ಅರ್ಹರು ಯಾರು ಎಂದು ತೀರ್ಮಾನಿಸುವುದು ಹೇಗೆ ?</p>
		<p>ತಂತ್ರಜ್ಞಾನ ಹಾಗೂ ಮುದ್ರಣಯಂತ್ರವನ್ನು ನೀಡಿ ಅಕ್ಷರ ಕ್ರಾಂತಿಗೆ ಎಡೆ ಮಾಡಿದ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ ಉಳ್ಳವರ ಜ್ಞಾನವನ್ನು ಬಯಸುವವರ ಬಳಿಗೆ ಹರಿಸಿ ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಕ್ರಾಂತಿಗೆ ನಾಂದಿ ಹಾಡಿದೆ. ಆಕಾಶವಾಣಿ, ದೂರದರ್ಶನ ಇತ್ಯಾದಿಗಳು, ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಕ್ರಾಂತಿಯ ಗತಿಯನ್ನು ಇನ್ನಷ್ಟು ವೇಗಗೊಳಿಸಿವೆ. ಈ ಸಮಗ್ರ ತಾಂತ್ರಿಕ ಜ್ಞಾನವು ಪ್ರಗತಿಯ ಸಾಧನಕ್ಕೆ ಅಮೂಲ್ಯವಾಗಿದೆ. ಇನ್ನು ಕೇವಲ 10-15 ವರ್ಷಗಳಲ್ಲಿ 20ನೆಯ ಶತಮಾನವನ್ನು ದಾಟಿ, ಬರುವ ಶತಮಾನದ ಬಾಗಿಲನ್ನು ತೆರೆದು ಭಾರತದ ಭವಿಷ್ಯವನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟಲು ಹೊರ ಬಂದಿದ್ದೇವೆ. ಇದಕ್ಕೆ ನಾವೆಲ್ಲರೂ ಭಾರತದ ಭವಿಷ್ಯದ ಭದ್ರ ಬುನಾದಿಯನ್ನು ಕಟ್ಟುವ ಅಮೋಘ ಆದರ್ಶವನ್ನು ಮುಂದಿಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡು﻿ ಸಾಗಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ನವೋದಿತ ಯುವ ಪದವೀಧರರಾದ ನೀವು ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರ ಕಟ್ಟುವ ಮಹತ್ಕಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಮಭಾಗಿಗಳಾಗಬೇಕು ಎಂದು ನಿಮಗೆ ನಾನು ಆಹ್ವಾನಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ. ಅನೇಕರ ಬೆವರು ನಮ್ಮ ಉನ್ನತಿಯ ಹಿಂದೆ ಕಾಣದಂತಿದೆ ಎಂಬುದನ್ನೂ ಮರೆಯಬಾರದು. ಆ ಬೆವರನ್ನು ಕೊಂಚಮಟ್ಟಿಗಾದರೂ ಒರೆಸುವ ಪುಣ್ಯ ಕಾವ್ಯಕ್ಕೆ ನೀವು ದೀಕ್ಷೆ ತೊಡಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಈ ಕ್ಷಣದಲ್ಲಿ ನಾನು, ಸ್ವಾಮಿ ವಿವೇಕಾನಂದರ ಸಿಂಹವಾಣಿಯನ್ನು ಸ್ಮರಿಸುತ್ತೇನೆ :</p>
		<p>“I call him a traitor who, having been educated, nursed in luxury by the hearts' blood of the downtrodden millions of toiling poor, never even takes a thought for them.” ಕಟುವಾಗಿದ್ದರೂ ಅತ್ಯಂತ ಹಿತಕಾರಿಯಾದ ಈ ಸಂಜೀವಿನಿಯಂತಿರುವ ಈ ಮಹಾಪುರುಷನ ಈ ಮಂತ್ರವಾದ ಮಾತು ಸದಾ ನಮ್ಮ ಸ್ಮರಣೆ ಯಲ್ಲಿರಲಿ.</p>
		<p>ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ರಂಗದಲ್ಲಿ ಸ್ವತಂತ್ರ ಭಾರತ ಅಭಿಮಾನದ ಪ್ರಗತಿ ಸಾಧಿಸಿದೆ. ಭಾರತೀಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣತಜ್ಞರು ಜಗತ್ತಿನ ಅನೇಕ ವಿದ್ಯಾ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಗಣ್ಯಸ್ಥಾನ ಪಡೆದಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಆದನ್ನೂ ಕೆಲವು ಸಮಯ ನಮ್ಮ ಭವಿಷ್ಯದ ಬೆಳಕಿಗೆ ಆಶಾ ದಾಯಕವಾಗಬೇಕಾದ ವಿದ್ಯಾಮಂದಿರಗಳ ನಿರಾಶೆಯ ನೆರಳನ್ನೂ ಚೆಲ್ಲುತ್ತಿವೆ. ಅಧ್ಯಾಪಕವರ್ಗ ಹಾಗೂ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿವೃಂದಗಳು ಮರ್ಯಾದೆಯ ಮೇರೆದಪ್ಪಿ ಅನ್ಯ ಪ್ರಚೋದನೆಗೆ ಒಳಪಟ್ಟು, ವಿದ್ಯಾಮಂದಿರಗಳ ಪವಿತ್ರ ವಾತಾವರಣವನ್ನು ಕದಡಿಸುವ ಅನೇಕ ಪ್ರಸಂಗಗಳು ಅನುಭವಕ್ಕೆ ಬಂದಿವೆ. ದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ನವೋದಯ ಮೂಡಿಸಿ ನವ ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಸಂಸ್ಕರಣ ನಡೆಸಿ ಜನ ಜೀವನದ ಪ್ರವಾಹವನ್ನು ಪ್ರಗತಿಯ ಪಾತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾಗಿಸುವ ಪವಿತ್ರ ಕಾವ್ಯದಲ್ಲೀಗ ವಿದ್ಯಾಮಂದಿರಗಳು ತೊಡಗಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಹಿಂಸೆ, ಭ್ರಷ್ಟಾಚಾರ ಜಾತೀಯತೆಯನ್ನು ಮೆಟ್ಟಿಕ್ಕಿ, ತ್ಯಾಗ, ಸೃಜನಶೀಲತೆ, ಲೋಕಬಂಧುತ್ವವನ್ನು ಬೆಳೆಸಿ, ಅತ್ಯುನ್ನತ ಜೀವನ ಮೌಲ್ಯಗಳನ್ನು ಎತ್ತಿ ಹಿಡಿದು, ಜಗತ್ತಿಗೆ ತೋರಿಸುವ ಸತ್ಪಯತ್ನವೀಗ ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ನಡೆಯಬೇಕಾಗಿದೆ. ಜನಜೀವನದಲ್ಲಿ ಹೊಸ ಚೈತನ್ಯದ ಬೆಳಕನ್ನು ಹಾಗೂ ಉಜ್ವಲ ಆತ್ಮಶಕ್ತಿಗಳನ್ನು ತುಂಬಿ ಅಜ್ಞಾನದ ತಮೋ ರಾಶಿಯನ್ನು ಹೊಡೆದೋಡಿಸು﻿ವುದು ವಿದ್ಯೆಯ ಹಾಗೂ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಜನೆಯ ಉದ್ದೇಶವಾಗಿರಬೇಕು. ಧಾರ್ಮಿಕ, ಆರ್ಥಿಕ, ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ರಂಗಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಆದರ್ಶ ತುಂಬಿ ಪ್ರಗತಿ ಸಾಧಿಸಿ, ಹೊಸ ಸಮಾಜವನ್ನು ಸಂಘಟಿಸುವುದಕ್ಕೆ ಸಹಾಯಮಾಡುವುದು ನಮ್ಮೆಲ್ಲರ ಕರ್ತವ್ಯ. ಜನತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಸ್ನೇಹಬಾಂಧವ್ಯ, ಸಮಾನತೆ, ಐಕ್ಯ, ಸತ್ಯ, ಅಹಿಂಸೆ, ಸದಾಚಾರಗಳು ಬೆಳೆಯಬೇಕೆಂಬುದೇ ಶಿಕ್ಷಣದ ಮೂಲ ಸಂದೇಶ. ನಿಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿ ಆತ್ಮ ನಿರೀಕ್ಷಣೆ, ಅಂತಃಶುದ್ದಿ, ಸರಳತೆ, ಸದಾಚಾರ, ವಿನಯ ಮೂಡಿ ನಿಮ್ಮ ಬಾಳಿನಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಸ್ಪೃಹ ಭಾವ, ನಿಷ್ಠೆ, ಆತ್ಮವಿಶ್ವಾಸ ಬೆಳೆದು ದೀನದಲಿತರ ಬಗೆಗೆ ದಯೆ, ಕರುಣೆ, ಅನುಕಂಪಗಳು ಚಿಗುರಿ ನಿಮ್ಮನ್ನು ಸತ್ಕಾರ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ತೊಡಗಿಸಲಿ. ಆ ದಿಶೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಿಮಗೆ ಚೇತನ ತುಂಬಿಬರಲಿ, ದಾರಿದ್ರ, ಜಾಡ್ಯದ ಜಟಿಲ ಸಮಸ್ಯೆಗೊಳಗಾದ ಜನತೆಯನ್ನು ಉದ್ಧರಿಸಿ, ಸಚೇತನ ಸಮಾಜದ ಸಂಘಟನೆಯ ಮಹತ್ಕಾರ ನಿಮ್ಮಿಂದ ನಡೆಯಲಿ. ಸರ್ವಜ್ಞ ಹೇಳಿದ : “ ನಡೆವುದೊಂದೇ ನೆಲವು, ಕುಡಿವುದೊಂದೇ ಜಲವು. ಸುಡುವ ಒಂದೇ ಇರುತಿರಲು ಕುಲಗೋತ್ರ ನಡುವೆ ಎತ್ತಣದು.” ಎಂಬ ಜಾತ್ಯತೀತದ ಮೂಲ ಮಂತ್ರವನ್ನು ಎತ್ತಿ ಹಿಡಿದು, ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರದ ಐಕ್ಯತೆಯನ್ನು ಕಾಪಾಡಿ. ವಿಶ್ವಶಾಂತಿಗೆ ದಾರಿ ದೀಪ ತೋರಿಸಿದ ಮಹಾತ್ಮಗಾಂಧೀಜಿ ಹಾಗೂ 'ಇಂದಿರಾಜಿ ಅವರ ಬಲಿದಾನದ ಆದರ್ಶವನ್ನು, “ವಸುಧೈವ ಕುಟುಂಬಕಂ ” ಎಂಬ ಉದಾತ್ತ ಗುರಿಯನ್ನು, ಮನದಲ್ಲಿಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡು ಮುಂದೆ ಸಾಗೋಣ.</p>
		<p>ನಾನು ಇನ್ನೊಮ್ಮೆ ನಿಮ್ಮೆಲ್ಲರಿಗೂ ನನ್ನ ಶುಭೇಚ್ಛೆಗಳನ್ನು ಸಲ್ಲಿಸಿ, ನಿಮ್ಮ ಭಾವೀ ಜೀವನವು ಸುಖಮಯವಾಗಲೆಂದು ಹಾರೈಸುತ್ತೇನೆ.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Saturday, 14th Mar. 1987 CONVOCATION ADDRESS BY<br />Mr. K. R. NARAYANAN,UNION MINISTER OF STATE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,<br />ATOMIC ENERGY, SPACE, ELECTRONICS AND OCEAN DEVELOPMENT</h1>
		<p><em>Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Pro-Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Members of the Faculty, Graduates of the Year, Ladies and Gentlemen,</em></p>
		<p>I have great pleasure to participate in this sixtyseventh Convocation of the University of Mysore. You have conferred on me a great honour by inviting me to deliver the Convocation Address. May I thank you for this gesture. May I also, at the outset, extend my hearty congratulations and best wishes to the students who have taken their degrees today, especially those who have received their prizes and medals and are standing tip-toe with expectation at the threshold of a new and challenging stage of life. I have no doubt that it was a great experience for you to have been educated in this University, which has such a high reputation for academic excellence and which is situated in the garden city of Karnataka with its natural beauty, its treasures of sandalwood and gold, its graces of traditional arts and culture, and its modern set-up of science, technology and industry symbolising a fine synthesis of old and new India.</p>
		<p>Mr. Chancellor, India, as we all know, is a land where the human mind has soared to incredible heights of thought and philosophy and plumbed the unfathomable depths of the mind and soul of man. It is here in this﻿ land that perhaps the first fundamental questions were asked of the origin and the nature of the universe and of the predicament of mankind. The tradition of the persuit of knowledge was therefore long established, and learning was held in high respect and rewarded be it in gurukulas, ashramas, viswavidyalayas or in exceptional individuals. However, knowledge in this elevated form was the preserve of a creative minority at the uppermost layer of society though a few from below often managed to slip to the top through the meshes of the social network. To the vast majority of the people who remained outside the privileged sphere, religious and philosophical concepts, and knowledge in general, were purveyed in drastically, though beautifully simplified forms through mythologies, rituals and popular literature that captured the emotions and imagination of the masses. It was a magnificent feat of popularisation and communication on a grand scale which could arouse the envy of modern informatics with all its electronic equipment and gadgetry. The fact, however, remains that there was in this golden age of ours a yawning gap in knowledge or in education, to use modern parlance, between a small minority on the top and the immense majority below and all around. Even in respect of the basic instrument of education and communication, viz., language, a gap existed in the sense that Sanskrit with all its literary and philosophical treasures was not the tongue of the common people.</p>
		<p>This situation prevailed almost throughout history as far as the all-India level was concerned, though the upper class language changed from Sanskrit to Persian and then to English. During the long period of British rule a new chasm came into being between the English educated﻿ and the rest of the people with the modernised sections of the semi-feudal society and the new industrial bourgeoisie and intelligentsia at the head of the social and administrative power-structure and the masses. Although there was a greater degree of social mobility in this system, basically the wide gap between the educated and the custodians of knowledge on the one hand, and the illiterate masses on the other remained almost super-imposed on the caste, social hierarchies and inequalities of the older order. Universities and educational establishments of the modern kind were in fact, though not in law and theory, institutions standing quite apart from the generality of the people, notwithstanding the filtration process associated with the new education. Even to-day the alienation of the educated from the people is an alarming phenomenon inspite of the tidal wave of the freedom movement that swept the country, the advent of popular democracy, and the intermittent assaults of socialistic ideas and demands on the system. What Rabindranath Tagore said of the educated classes in India, that they were like, a second storey added to an old family house with the architect forgetting to construct a staircase in-between, seems to be still essentially true of the social scene in India.</p>
		<p>I have inflicted upon yon these rather breezy generalizations in order to highlight the current position of the university in our society and its role in the context of the developmental tasks facing the nation. It is true that today our universities and educational institutions are swelling enormously with numbers with over 3.5 million students in the universities and about 130 million in the school system, straining national resources and lowering standards of education. Yet the fact is that only 38 per﻿cent of the people are literate with a much smaller per centage managing to get inside the portals of higher institutions of learning. If our universities have been called ivory towers, they are crowded ivory towers, alienated from the masses, their relevance to the problems of the people being remote and their involvement in the vital developmental process almost insignificant.</p>
		<p>How can we make the universities and the academic and student community actors and participants in the process of development? The University is a place of independent thinking, where young minds open up and evolve in an atmosphere of freedom and amidst the clash of opinions and ideas. There is thus a conflict between this inherent objective of a University, and the attempt to narrow it down and to harness it to some specific practical national tasks, bringing to bear upon it pressures of society and the machinery of the State. Is there an irreconcilable contradiction between the traditional idea of the University and the demands on it being increasingly made by society today? I do not think so. As Professor A. N. Whitehead said "In the process of learning there should be present, in some sense or another, a subordinate activity of application. In fact, the applications are part of knowledge. For, the very meaning of things is wrapped up in relationships beyond themselves. Thus, unapplied knowledge is knowledge shorn of its meaning".</p>
		<p>The current conditions in our country offer exciting opportunities for such subordinate but vital activity of applications of knowledge in the process of learning itself, establishing some sort of healthy balance in the University system between education, research and social service. First of all, it should be possible to introduce in the study of individual disciplines a new direction which emphasizes and brings out in practical terms their relevance to developmental problems, especially in the study of social sciences, economics, agriculture, architecture, engineering, urban development, environment, health sciences, managerial, physical and earth sciences. We need a problem-oriented rather than a narrowly subject-oriented education, in our schools and universities. To acquire knowledge without a central purpose and any sort of subordinate application would be to gather knowledge devoid of meaning and relevance.</p>
		<p>We are all aware that the Gandhian system of education had emphasised the joy and excitement of doing things while learning and carrying out service to the people as an integral part of education. Though not in the Gandhian way we had from time to time made halting and haphazard attempts in taking up some of the service aspects of education. In 1969.70 we started pilot projects in 37 Universities enrolling 40,000 student-volunteers in order to expose youth to social problems and to stimulate them to do service under the National Service Scheme. That and similar efforts never got off the ground. That must have been partly because in society as a whole there did not exist the spirit of service and the values associated with it. As a people we have been notoriously averse to manual work except those traditionally condemned to labour, an attitude engendered by the caste system. That was essentially a projection of the general attitude of our society which Swami Vivekananda decried when he made his famous remarks about the obsessive pursuit of personal purity by the Indian. “Our religion", he said, is in the kitchen,﻿ our God in the cooking pot; touch me not. I am holy". This traditional attitude was paradoxically fortified by modern bourgeois-bureaucratic values imbibed by the intelligentsia which placed a higher value on sedentary Government service than active work in agriculture, industry or business. Fortunately industrialisation and technological changes are gradually breaking down such false and regressive value systems and attitudes. But we need a thorough-going peaceful, cultural revolution in our country that would completely breakdown narrow domestic walls, dead habits and debilitating distinctions and prejudices so that dignity of labour and mobility of labour are brought about on large scale opening up work of all kinds and opportunities for our young people, enabling their talents and genius to blossom rather than being kept in constricted compartments.</p>
		<p>In this context, may I recount a Japanese story. There was a young man who was bitten with curiosity with regard to the ultimate secret of life on earth. He was told of a Buddhist sage who could reveal the secret to him. The young man went in search of him and on reaching the home of the sage he impatiently asked him what the secret of life was. The sage said, 'Young man you have come a long way, have a bath first. After the bath, he posed the question again to the sage who advised him to rest a little and then have lunch. The lunch over, the young man put the question again and awaited with bated breath for the truth about the secret of life. The answer the sage gave was, 'Let us wash the dishes'. I hope I am not pouring cold water on the bursting enthusiasm of our young people by telling this story. Because, I believe, life is as much a matter of high idealism and hitching your﻿ wagon to a star as washing dishes and doing things by your own hands. In fact, one can often 'reach the unreachable stars' only if one is prepared to wash the dishes on earth. I can tell you that many Indians who went to Europe and America and became affluent and great did so after passing through a spell of dish-washing experience. Even a great hero like Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam did that once.</p>
		<p>I should like now to deal with another aspect of the alienation of our Universities from society--that is lack of effective relationship between the University and Industry. We are today passing through a major industrial and technological revolution. The future jobs for our young people are in the sector of industry, technology, commerce and in the rapidly developing services sector, apart from opportunities in the vast agricultural and rural sector. To day, there is hardly any nexus between the university and the industry and even science and technology are developed in the specialised institutes and laboratories rather than in the more natural habitat of the University system. Universities can become relevant to national development when they are the main centres for the study and promotion of science and technology. For bringing about this crucial change the Government and Society have as much responsibility as universities themselves. In the famous SILICON VALLEY in the West Coast of the United States of America the genesis of the great electronics revolution centered around one university---the University of Stanford. It was from its research facilities and its faculty and students and the technological parks established around it that the electronics industry developed out of the intellectual and productive inter-action and collaboration﻿ between industries and the universities. In the mainly brain-based electronic industry of the future the university has an important role to play which would eventually bring about innumerable new jobs for the students who come out of our educational institutions.</p>
		<p>A study team appointed by the Department of Electronics of the Ministry of Science and Technology has estimated that the total annual additional requirements of trained man power in the electronics sector would be 1,25,282 by the end of the 7th Five Year Plan. This volume of new employment created refers only to direct employment in the electronic and computer sector and not the indirect employment that would be generated in the economy as a whole. It is necessary for the universities to begin, seriously and systematically, research and development work in collaboration with our growing industrial sector and also to train students in these new branches of science and technology. The Government has launched a new programme for encouraging and helping our educational institutions in establishing training courses for electronics, and they are planning to set up National Institutes of Informatics Technology (NIIT) in four regions of the country. Of course, apart from all these, Government is also planning to give a vocational and technological bent to our education as envisaged in the new educational policy. It is our aim to make our schools and colleges and higher institutes of learning to turn out young people who are eminently employable and who would be forerunners in the development race to the 21st century that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has initiated.</p>
		<p>Though we have taken it as an axiom, I must nevertheless emphasis here the over-riding importance of﻿ education in national development not only of higher education but primary and secondary education and also mass education. Eradication of illiteracy is central to this, because, without the majority of our population literate, neither the benefits of development nor the door of the 21st century will be open to us. That is why Prime Minister has declared eradication of illiteracy as an emergency programme called a technological mission to be carried out within a 15 year period. I should like to point out here the experience of Japan in this context. The success of Japan in industrialisation is often misunderstood in India as a result of imitative genius. According to a historian, "Any attempt to explain Japan's exceptional success in national development must give a high degree of credit to the educational system which took in its modern guise just a 100 years ago".</p>
		<p>The 1872 Education Code of Japan pronounced that “There shall in future be no community with an illiterate family, nor a family with an illiterate person". In the post-war period Japan took another major decision that educational planning should constitute the main aspect of economic planning. This is a priority that we can well follow in India.</p>
		<p>Jawaharlal Nehru once said: "A University stands for humanism, for tolerance, for reason, for progress, for the adventure of ideas, and for the search of truth. It stands for the onward march of the human race towards our higher objectives. If the Universities discharge their duties adequately, then it is well with the nations and the people. But if the temple of learning itself becomes a home of narrow bigotry and petty objectives, how then will the nation progress or a person grow in stature?".﻿</p>
		<p>In India today, it has become imperative for us to riase above narrow bigotry and petty objectives. National vision and national integration have been inherent in our culture and civilization. But, they have become today indispensable for the progress of the whole of India as well as of each and every part of it. The compulsion of development and our predicament in the world have made unity of India and inter-dependance of India and of the Indian people a reality and a necessity. Youth who constitute the majority of our population today are no longer just the leaders of tomorrow but of today. They have already inherited India with all its difficult problems and exciting opportunities and prospects. They have today the privilege of being part of the great adventure of uplifting millions of our people from poverty, malnutrition and ignorance, building a strong united progressive India, and contributing to the peace and prosperity of the world. These are great tasks and to shoulder them you have to prepare yourselves for the responsibility and leadership that is devolving upon you. It is an inevitable and indispensable responsibility. But as Justice Holmes put it "The inevitable comes to pass through efforts". The University is a forum for efforts, for joyous creative efforts in order to shape your own future and the future of the nation. May I wish you all success in these noble efforts.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">ADDRESS BY Justice E.S. VENKATARAMIAH on Tuesday, 1st Mar. 1988<br />Hon'ble Chancellor, Hon'ble Vice-Chancellor,<br />Graduates of the Year, Brothers and Sisters,</h1>
		<p>University of Mysore is my Alma Mater. On completion of my studies in 1943 at Maharaja's College which was the chief unit of this university, I joined the University of Bombay as a student. After a lapse of about 44 years, an opportunity has been provided to me to participate in the Convocation of the University, of Mysore. I acknowledge my gratitude to the authorities of the University for this.</p>
		<p>On this occasion, I offer my humble salutations to the members of the teaching community of this university who taught me. I sincerely feel that it is only because of their good wishes that I have been successful in my life. Those who teach us to read and write in our childhood and those who in our youth impart the right education required for us to achieve our subsequent objectives are as important as our parents. The upanishad dictum "Acharya Devo Bhava" proclaims so. I always remember the help rendered to me by my teachers. This reminiscence alone is my precious armour.</p>
		<p>About 44 years ago, I had also participated, like the new graduates who have assembled here today, in a function at Jaganmohan Palace where degrees. were awarded. I received two gold medals from the then Chancellor, His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore.</p>
		<p>There is a vast difference between those times and now. Then the degree classes were conducted only in four colleges in the University of Mysore. All those who had qualified for the award of the degree could assemble in the auditorium of the Jaganmohan Palace and receive their degrees. It was possible to announce the names of all the graduates and to introduce them to the Chancellor as well. At present﻿ this is impossible. The situation now is that hundreds of colleges have been established and thousands of students receive their degrees. This is due to the increase in population and the relative increase in student strength. Therefore, earlier conventions have to be given up. Yet, I would like to offer on this occasion my good wishes to all those who are receiving their degrees today, in person or in absentia. I wish them a purposeful life as worthy citizens of our nation.</p>
		<p>The path of life is multifaceted. Those who receive their degrees today would acquire various positions and honours in future, shoulder responsibilities of their own and meet the challenge of their personal lives and also further the interest of the nation. Hence it is customary to say a word or two by way of advice to them on this occasion. Therefore, kindly permit me to speak a few words.</p>
		<p>It is 40 years since India attained freedom. What have we achieved ? What are we going to achieve in future ? Now is the proper time to think over the issue. By 1857 A.D., British power was deep-rooted in India. The Sipoy Mutiny which took place in that year was the first and really momentous call of our freedom struggle. Though deceitful tactics adopted by the British divided the Indian people into different groups and made them subservient to their rule, the British thirst for power and the imperialist ideology did not have the thrust required to contain nationalism and the desire for freedom.</p>
		<p>The Indian National Congress was established subsequently. The spirited call for freedom that was heard everywhere was the joint result of the enthusiasm of the nationalists who were influenced by the Congress, and the wildfire generated by the division of Bengal. The First World War (1914-1918) intensified the nationalistic fervour of Indians. The sagacity, eloquence and the spirit of sacrifice of Gopalkrishna Gokhale, Balagangadhara Tilak, Lala﻿ Lajpat Roy, Bipinchandra Pal and later by Mahatma Gandhi when he assumed leadership further strengthened the freedom movement in India. By then the influence of Mahatma Gandhi had reached its peak. Thousands of people sacrificed their lives for freedom, they fell victims to bullets and blood flowed in the streets. Farmers, merchants, students, teachers, lawyers, doctors, a few Government officers, in short, people from all walks of life sacrificed everything to attain political freedom and rid our land of the British. They went to jail, became invalid, discontinued their studies, lost their home and property. Ultimately India became free on the 15th of August, 1947. But the subcontinent was also divided into two. We are grateful for ever to every individual who made sacrifices in the cause of our political freedom. Let us pay homage to all of them on this occasion.</p>
		<p>Until 1947, there was a single goal set for the Indians, that of political freedom. This was due to the nationalism and patriotic spirit of the people. This goal and the cause succeeded in freeing us from political slavery and made India one among the free nations of the world. This is an important stage in our history. We could now proceed to examine what happened subsequently.</p>
		<p>On 26th January 1950, i.e., within two years eleven months and eighteen days after freedom 'we drafted the constitution and established the Indian Republic, More than five hundred princely states which were in existence till then were incorporated into the Indian Nation. Within a few years the French and the Portuguese colonies of India also became part of the Indian Nation India became one integrated whole. Under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru and of Vallabhbhai Patel the Indian republic marched ahead</p>
		<p>The aims and objectives of Indian constitution are depicted in its preamble. We, the people of India﻿ having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign socialist secular democratic republic and to secure for all its citizens justice, social, economical and political; liberty of thought and expression and freedom to profess and practise any religion, faith and worship; equality of status and of opportunity and to promote in the people fraternal feelings which would reaffirm the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation, have adopted and enacted this constitution of India.</p>
		<p>India is one nation. In the constitution it is stated at various places that the integrity of the country should be safeguarded by those who are at the helm of affairs. It is the duty of every citizen to protect the freedom of India. According to the constitution every Indian is merely a citizen of India and not a member of this sect or that. In short, we are all Indians. Moreover, the fundamental rights of the people of India and the directive principles of state policy are clearly stated in the constitution. It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to respect the national flag and the national anthem; to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our struggle for freedom; to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India, to render service when called upon to do so in order to defend the country against external aggression, to promote harmony and the spirit of brotherhood among the people of India transcending religious, linguistic regional or communal differences; to renounce practices not consistent with the dignity of woman; to value, preserve and consolidate the rich heritage of our composite culture and its values; to protect the environment, inclusive of forests, lakes, rivers and wild life and to have compassion for all living creatures; to develop the scientific temper, humanism, the rationalistic outlook, the spirit of inquiry and social reform; to safeguard public property and to abjure violence, to strive towards the highest levels﻿ of achievement in personal and public spheres. India is a federal state though it is not clearly stated so in the Indian constitution. It is the largest republic state consisting of a Union Government, 25 State Governments and 7 Union Territories and with a population of 800 million people. A number of laws are necessary to rule the country in accordance with the constitution. Those who rule must also have proper tactfulness. The constitution should not be a prison house for an obsolete system of life ; it should reflect our aspirations and be a lamp that lights the road ahead. The constitution cannot afford to be the printed ultimate which cannot be changed. It should be alive and must have the potency to inspire. It ought to become an excellent means for fulfilling the people's aspirations.</p>
		<p>Four main pillars are needed for India to march forward as a good, welfare state retaining its sovereignty and integrity. First of all every region of India should be an indivisible part of the nation. Secondly, a high premium must be placed on social justice.</p>
		<p>Thirdly, peace should prevail all over the country, Fourthly, cordiality and an unshakable faith in the welfare of the people, rather than selfishness, be cultivated. These are the four pillars. Their realization ought to be the aim of every Indian citizen.</p>
		<p>Prior to the attainment of political freedom patriotism was the only driving force behind Indians. For about seven or eight years after independence the sacrifices made by the freedom fighters were still fresh in the people's memory. "We are all one, the whole of India is ours"-the hearts of the people were filled with this feeling. As years passed, this feeling gradually lost its intensity. Love of one's caste, religion, language and region gained in strength and the separatist attitude which is now conspicuous here and there, began to manifest itself. People﻿ started forgetting the value of freedom. The examples set in the political field by Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Rajaji were erased and a decline set in. Now if you take any newspaper in the early morning what do you read ? Murder in the name of politics, robbery, assault on woman, bribery, political immorality, bund loss to public property, irregularities in universities--an assortment of corruptions fills the major part of the newspaper. If this trend is not stopped, India will fall into irretrievable depths in the near future. All will be lost, if a moral revolution does not take place now. This moral revolution can be effected only by the youth of today. For such a revolution to materialise certain timely strategies have to be adopted. First of all every young man should have a feeling that he is Indian first; he should set aside his inclinations towards caste, religion, language and region.</p>
		<p>Let me now reveal a secret no politician or government official who has benefited in the name of caste has ever helped the ordinary man in his caste ! If he has faith in the constitution and in laws, he .cannot help people of any particular community. He has to view all citizens uniformly. If he is inclined by nature to abuse power and to act against the constitution he would still help only his relatives, friends and those who have given him money. He would not help the other members of his community. The common people who are not able to understand this simple fact continue to fall into the traps set by the casteists. If you find here and there a few people who have progressed, it is on account of their own strength and not because of a minister or an officer belonging to their caste. But today's illusory context is such as to make an individual in Mysore district derive greater pleasure when someone in Bidar district who belongs to his caste but is not known to him gets a job, than when a neighbour intimately known to him but belonging to another caste gets the same﻿ job. If the neighbour concerned gets the job he feels infinitely jealous. Is this not real misfortune ? Is this not a symptom of inhumanity ? Take the election scene. Law says that nobody shall be elected through propaganda based on caste and religion But consider the candidates chosen by the political parties. In the constituencies where members of a certain caste or religion outnumber others, individuals of that caste or religion are selected as candidates.</p>
		<p>Consider the surveys that appear in newspaper as election previews. They base their predictions of possible, winners on consideration of caste and religion of the constituency. Do we really conduct our political affairs keeping at a distance caste and religion ? I do not know when we would come out of this delusion. But our practice is even now violative of the constitution and the laws. A few might speculate about the candidates who are likely to secure higher marks in the University examinations in several places in the same way. Often the speculation does not depend on the merit of the student. These examples had to be cited to describe the mishaps that occur on account of caste, religion etc. Such is the toxic effect of caste and religion that whether it is the mariage pandal, rail or bus travel, universities or legislature-everywhere we hear only caste and religion being mentioned. It is difficult to say when we can get rid of this plague. I pray to my young brethern to root out the evil.</p>
		<p>We have lagged far behind in providing social justice to all-particularly to the poor. How long would it be possible for 70 percent of Indians to endure poverty? They continue to be plagued by hunger, illiteracy and ill-health. Many have no clothes to wear, no homes to stay in. The situation in the villages is agonising. Those who migrate to the cities live in slums like wretched vermin. What is the remedy that would remove the anguish caused by poverty ?﻿</p>
		<p>A meeting of Man and Nature (Purusha and Prakruti) is needed. I am not expounding Sankhya Vada, but am suggesting a way out of our present economic crisis.</p>
		<p>We have abundant natural resources; our manpower is immense. But our people lack the capacity to utilise the natural resources. Take the example of Japan, Taiwan and Singapore. Though they do not have extraordinary natural resources, in a short span of 40 years they have harnessed their manpower to the utmost effect and are now in a position to hold out a threat to the U.S.A. in the economic sphere. But our position is diametrically opposed to theirs.</p>
		<p>First of all, efforts have to be made immediately in India to build 25 new cities where about 50 million people could live comfortably. The practice of adding new extensions to the existing cities has to be dropped. Existing cities have lost the capacity to accommodate suitably those who migrate from the villages. You might have read in the newspapers recently the steps taken by Japan to reduce the pressure of population on Tokyo city. We have to follow that example. Instead of taking the Telugu-Ganga water to Madras by expending 500 crore rupees, it is better to build a new capital in Tiruchirapalli district on the banks of the Kavery by spending 500 crore rupees, as the late M. G Ramachandran used to say.</p>
		<p>Instead of supplying the Kavery water to Bangalore with an expenditure of 250 crore rupees, it is possible to build a new city on the banks of the Tungabhadra by spending 250 crore rupees. To prevent people from living on the pavements of Bombay, a new capital for Maharashtra may be built on the banks of the Godavari. The headquarters of all public institutions need not be located in Delhi. They could be shifted to cities newly built. Hundreds of mills situated in the city of Bombay should be shifted to and distributed in the various districts. Until the process of shifting is over the labourers﻿ should continue to receive their pay. I have heard from informed circles that it is possible. I have also heard that it should be possible to build good houses for the labourers in the new locations. By the sale of lands where the mills are now situated, huge amounts of money may be collected. If Calcutta is to survive, another city has to be built which can reduce the pressure of population on Calcutta. Such programmes, if undertaken, would provide jobs to lakhs of people, people would get good houses to live in. In the big cities we have to pay now a price of Rs. 1,000/- to Rs. 10,000/- for a square yard of land. Is this not shameful? Why should we allow the landlords in the cities to make unwarranted profit ? The rent-control law is of no avail, for only tenancy cases are increasing in number. Public welfare will be achieved only when new houses are constructed. However, politicians do not think along these lines. They do not like to leave big cities. How can those living in big government bungalows be aware of the difficulties the common people have to face ?</p>
		<p>The existing highways have to be broadened. Efforts should be made to build new roadways. Railway lines have to be extended. Many benefits will flow from these. Thousands of petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court, demanding job opportunities. Most of these cases have been decided and appropriate orders have been passed. Everyone who is capable of work has got to eat. Therefore food-grains have to be supplied to him. If he is without work the nation will lose the benefit of his capacity to work. Manpower is a gradually wasting asset. If a person does not work for a day the thing he could have produced or the service he could have rendered on that day is lost to the nation. To that extent there is a reduction in the Gross National Product in India.</p>
		<p>If all are provided with jobs, a large number of crimes that now take place would not happen. A man﻿ without a job falls a prey to evil inclinations. It is our duty to provide everyone with work in this country. If all are engaged in work the purchasing power of the people, especially of the poorer people, will increase. The derand for materials and services will also increase, and to fulfil the demand we have to appoint more and more people. New job avenues will open up and there will be greater opportunity for all people to be employed. This is a question of 'cycles' in the world of economy. Secondly when a person begins to work and earn, he develops greater interest in society, government and peace. His responsibility to the nation and answerability would increase. Bunds, destruction of public property, unrest and violence would decrease. As the standard of living goes up the families become smaller. The tendency to beget more children would be checked. •</p>
		<p>Because of the increase in population, the cultivable land available to man is gradually decreasing. Therefore it is necessary to develop more industries. The industries should be established in rural areas. Then the migration of the villagers to the cities would naturally decrease. If the economic change outlined above is to take place, people should become large-hearted, love for and faith in each other should come into being, peace and cordiality should prevail. This would be possible only through the development of human resources. There should be a rise in the level of intelligence and capacity for action. To achieve these, proper education is needed. The universities have to play an extremely important role here, and in particular,, the teachers have a major role to play. In recent days, the situation in the universities has become pathetic. I have a request to make to all of you. Kindly do not misunderstand what I say-I am talking about the universities in general. For any reason, do not promote to the next class a student who does not learn what he has been taught for if you did two offences would have been     committed. First, the future of the student has been spoiled, you have deprived him of a fortune--the opportunity to learn; his mind stagnates, he would eventually be a worthless person in society. Secondly, he turns out to be burden on society. The average intelligence of the society would decrease. Now we do not find individual like C.V. Raman or Ramanujam. The students coming out of a number of universities: do not pass in all India examinations like I.A.S. Advertisements state that the students of certain universities need not apply. There are a number of reasons for this state of affairs. Malpractices in examinations, students' indifferent attendance, internal feud of the teachers, growing interest in bunds and strikes etc., and the discrimination teachers show towards students. If a boy is his favourite, let the teacher teach him well. But no favour should be shown when it comes to marking. Such instances, many more similar instances, have been brought to light through the cases heard before the court.</p>
		<p>In universities, one expects greater discipline, a higher sense of dedication, of involvement and devotion both to teaching and learning. There should be a downward trend in litigation concerning university affairs. Intervention, in student affairs and university administration by political parties and politicians should be minimized.</p>
		<p>The laboratories of our colleges should be genuine laboratories, not mere showpieces. Attempts have to be made to create greater interest in the sciences among students. A majority of the students who score more than 70 percent of marks join medical and engineering colleges. The best are not inclined to study pure sciences. Hence talented students do not come forward to undertake research in universities. The Government should be more concerned about this issue. Students of exceptional talent have to be attracted to the study of pure sciences by awarding if necessary every student a﻿ fellowship of a thousand rupees a month. In a state like Karnataka, steps should be taken to ensure that at least 500 meritorious students study pure sciences every year in the universities. An expenditure of even 5 to 6 crores of rupees on this score would not be a bad proposition. I request the Government and the universities to build strong science departments so that the returns may be adequate.</p>
		<p>To cultivate the sense that we are all Indians, and to promote our environment in all its purity, it is important to teach nationalism and environmental protection to the children from the first standard in the primary school on to the tenth for at least one hour in a week. Inclination towards and a sense of cleanliness, rural sanitation and conservation of nature should be inculcated upon the children. If all these are firmly rooted in the young minds, the burden of the university at a later stage would be lessened.</p>
		<p>Earlier, I have pointed out a meeting of Man and Nature should take place. If the nation has to progress through a combination of natural resources and human effort, in addition to the programmes outlined above many others have to be taken up in the initiation of which I request all of you to be involved.</p>
		<p>No animal would voluntarily walk into the mouth of a sleeping lion. You have to wake up and work hard for the uplift of your self and of the nation. Do not forget the dictim: "Work is God." I wish all the best to the new graduates who are entering the vast arena of life on the completion of their student career. It is my wish that they would tone up our public life.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">CONVOCATION ADDRESS BY Smt. MARGARET ALVA,<br />MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF<br />HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.</h1>
		<p><em>Hon'ble Chancellor, Hon'ble Vice-Chancellor, Graduates of the Year, Brothers and Sisters,</em></p>
		<p>1 deem it a privilege to be invited to this great seat of learning to deliver the Convocation Address. It is my Alma Mater which has produced many outstanding personalities over the seventy-three years of its existence. I am specially grateful for the honour bestowed on me today by conferring on me the degree of " Doctor of Literature” a distinction which I know, I do not deserve, but which I humbly accept. Not many universities in the country can boast of a woman Vice-Chancellor. Dr. Selvie Das stands out as an example of a successful educationist and bold administrator, who has overcome many hurdles to reach this position. To have on a platform like this, two women, speaks much for the dynamism and new thinking of the University.</p>
		<p>We are graduates, you and I, of this great University. That is a privilege, but it carries great responsibilities. You go out into the main stream of life as young people to whom is handed the heritage﻿ of the past — with all that is precious in it and, with all its blemishes. It is for you to preserve what is good and to make good what is not, and to bring to the future the special touch of your generation. You come to this high responsibility as graduates in a nation where university education is still a luxury. In all you do, it is essential to remember, that you carry that proud label of being a graduate of this University. I feel deeply honoured to share it with you.</p>
		<p>Ours is a land in which contraction thrive and opposites co-exist. We see in its daily life many centuries telescoped into one, with many patterns of culture, each as ancient as the other, contesting for survival. There are so many demands, ever-growing, on a resource pool that always seems inadequate. Literacy percentages rise, but the actual numbers of illiterates go up : development takes place, but poverty in quantum terms increases; thousands throng the universities, but they come out less equipped to earn a living. Population pressure mounts and the disciplines of self-regulation crumble before the onslaught of the impatient, the frustrated, and the angry. We talk about bridging the many gulfs between our people, and of the need to be egalitarian in outlook and policy, while our systems, rules and regulations, and value systems, increase disparities. We create for the young, dreams of affluence which can neither be fulfilled nor are worthy of fulfilment. So many of the practices of a feudal-colonial past that should have little relevance when we are seeking a social﻿ transformation based on equality, encroach upon the present, destroying our capacity to cope with the challenge of change.</p>
		<p>Each solution generates a new set of problems. The growing aspirations of the people create a new quality of pressure on policy making. It is a situation in which the idea of a humane society, of</p>
		<p>good government' based on fairness and justice, to • be achieved through collective political wisdom, have gradually gone out of focus. Unless the consciousness of history is made the prime mover of the developmental process, we must of necessity end up creating tyrannical structures in the name of a mythical future that is never realised. For today's crisis.' is rooted in a process that has made the human being ( the citizen') the beneficiary of impersonal forces-means of production, economic institutions, technology, the state-rather than their creator.</p>
		<p>What is the solution ? Is it possible for us to create a political philosophy sufficiently dynamic and yet able to guarantee the stability of our democracy? The only way to go about this enormous task is to state categorically, that every theory and plan, will be tested on the basis of what it is likely to do for the mass of our people. This was Mahatma Gandhi's 'talisman'. Indian democracy demands a growth model which ensures substantial changes in the basic living condition of the mass of our people within their life-time. If it cannot be done in a democracy they will seek other ways. We need today to turn to the﻿ people who have bitherto been made the objects of all projects of history-making. This involves not just a new rhetoric but a new commitment on the part of the thinking strata, a new strategy of intervention, in the social process. And while considering the critical question of a new economic balance for our democratic transition, we must keep in mind the fact that the answer has to be found within the context of the Indian experience, at the base of the economic structure: in the lives of the peasant, the craftsman, the worker, the student, the woman, the unemployed, the homeless, the hungry and the exploited.</p>
		<p>Pandit Nehru had pointed out “...We have to promote industrialisation on a large and balanced scale, so as to add to the wealth of the country, and thus to the national dividend which can be equitably distributed.... But production by itself is not enough: for this may lead to an even greater concentration of wealth in a few hands. which, in the context of today, produces instability and conflict. Therefore, fair and equitable distribution is essential..."</p>
		<p>Speaking purely from the economics aspect, the top 20 per cent of our society today accounts for 52 per cent of the national income, while the bottom 40 per cent gets a mere 5 per cent. Even a 2 per cent shift in income from the top 20 per cent to the bottom 40 per cent will mean a growth of 40 por cent for the poorest in our society. We need to consider the implications of this for industrial growth and to the improvements in the living standards of﻿ the impoverished. Greater equity and even some redistribution in income therefore, has to assume a high place in our priorities.</p>
		<p>I believe it is possible to achieve the necessary corrections in our policies and implementation strategies, through democratic peaceful processes, if we begin to stir ourselves out of the old grooves. The economics of democracy in a developing society must be understood more creatively. No longer can we rest content with injecting radicalism into the content of planning. Our planning process must become a major weapon in the structural transformation of India. People's participation both in planning and implementing programmes for themselves must be ensured. Political and economic leadership must combine to attack the problem of poverty and despair.</p>
		<p>No society is stagnant, no society stands still. Therefore, unless the legal' system adapts itself to the changing needs of the people, it will not assure its viability in the challenging conditions of our age. What is needed is adjustment between the framing and implementation of laws on the one hand, and the aspirations of the people on the other. What we need. is an adequate theory of change and intervention... and this is precisely a time and a moment when the basic idea which is inherent in the constitution, namely, of building a humane, socially compassionate and politically just and equitable 'order' needs reworking-in the changed context. We have to ensure that the legal processes do guarantee﻿ the freedom and rights which we think are important to human relationships in society. We have to ensure that those who may be afraid or have been made to fear, find justice through the processes of law.</p>
		<p>Inaugurating the International Youth Year in 1985 our youthful Prime Minister said, “We must evaluate what we have achieved. We must identify the mistakes we have made, because it is only then that we can correct them and move ahead." We have to learn from the past and plan for the future. We have to combine the wisdom and spirituality of the ancient with the material, scientific and technological advance of the modern. It is only thus that we can grow into a peaceful, dynamic and progressive society. You have a vital role to play in the making of this new society. No country can progress if its young run away from responsibility. Be prepared for sacrifices--for hardship-for sweat and toil.</p>
		<p>You have acquired. many skills here. You have acquired knowledge and scholarship. You have acquired technique and discipline. You have acquired intellectual and moral values. All these are part of the talents you will use for creating this new society.</p>
		<p>Tagore had said :</p>
		<p>“ The great human societies are the creation not of profiteers but of dreamers":</p>
		<p>I say to you today-have a dream. Let it be a dream of personal betterment, of human betterment. Let it be a dream for your home, your village, your﻿ town; let it be a dream for India. Let your dream be a liberating force ; let it be a force for freedom ; let your dream' not be a solace for failure. but a spur to achievement. And may you make that dream come true......</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">CONVOCATION ADDRESS BY Dr. VS ARUNACHALAM,<br />SCIENTIFIC ADVISER TO THE DEFENCE MINISTER AND SECRETARY,<br />DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MINISTRY OF DEFENCE.</h1>	
		<p><em>Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Pro-Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Respected teachers of the university, graduates of the year, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,</em></p>
		<p>I am conscious of the honour the Mysore University has done me by its invitation to address its Seventieth Convocation. First, of course, is the very privilege of this invitation. For hasn't this address in the past been delivered by many eminent sons of our country? For, Mysore University has a long and rich tradition of learning and scholorship. Scholars thronged to this seat of learning with a chosen few serving the institution at one time or another in its history and enriching it by their intellectual might. There were the greats like our former President late Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, or our Kuvempu, the philosopher Prof. Yamunacharya and the physicist Pancharatnam. They all taught at this temple of learning,﻿ building and strengthening the rich tradition of scholorship the University is famous for. This invitation is also a source of personal pride for me: for, I was a student of this University some thirty five years ago studying science in a local college. Then, like all young men I wasn't also sure of what I wanted to be. Sometimes I would dream of becoming a writer or a journalist; but most often, it was science for me. The very environment of Mysore as I remembered was ideal for a student. The city is proud of its University, and she in turn, forms the cultural core and I do not remember an instance when the University was looked upon with anything except with pride and affection by the citizens of this city. I still cherish this period of my life often reliving the past many times over.</p>
		<p>Today, University education has started appearing as a contradiction in our perception of education needed for this country. This fear, I suspect, has arisen because of distortions in the very social fabric of our society. For, our country holds the unenviable record of having the largest number of illiterates among its people. Even primary education is not available to them and they have been denied or they have denied themselves opportunities for being, counted as a literate. India, it is said, lives in her villages, but alas, her schools do not live there. The statistics on village schools, the existing facilities, and the number of available teachers can make very discouraging reading. It may even appear that with the existing facilities we have no hopes of ever catching up with the stated national objective of providing everyone with at least a primary education. Alongside with this debilitating deficiency, we also boast of over one hundred fifty universities graduating a few lakhs of students annually. The spectrum of subjects and disciplines our universities cover is impressive: you only﻿ have to name a subject, which may be just unfolding or even be esoteric to be told that we have at least two universities teaching it and some may well have research programmes going! Many developed countries cannot boast of such accomplishments. Thus we have two societies in education intertwined uncomfortably with each other forming an India with a large uneducated populace as also with highly trained, technologically sophisticated, and knowledge-rich people. There are not many countries in the world with such strong and stark contrasts.</p>
		<p>Therefore, there is a desire in all of us to find ways and means for eliminating these contradictions. There are those who believe that primary education can only be pulled up by the creation and availability of economic opportunities to all the people, and they, in turn, will automatically opt for educating the young when economic deprivation is reduced. This belief, with some justification, is based on our cultural heritage and people's intrinsic desire to educate themselves, and therefore given opportunity and environment, literacy will automatically go up. On the otherhand, there are also those who believe that education has become elitist in our country, and universities and institutes have mushroomed taking away disproportionate amount of our resources at the expense of primary education. The only way it appears of clearing this imbalance is to abandon the support given to higher education at least for the time being, till the needs of the primary education are met. There is also an accompanying social concern about the desirability of producing so many graduates without much specialisation, who then look to the government for employment. This, then, is the problem. How are we going to meet the needs of the society for﻿ educating all without distorting the requirements for highly skilled and educated manpower?</p>
		<p>In this debate, may I hasten to make my position very clear. I am all for the university education for as many as can get in, for it constitutes the country's resource for an alround development. Sometimes, I fear that this strength is not so fully understood or appreciated. India is unique among the developing countries, the so-called Third World, in that she does not have to depend on others for her engineers, doctors, economists, scientists and administrators. Our universities have provided this core for generations making India run like a well-oiled machine. This is a unique phenomenon among the developing nations, for our country could transform herself without even a small dislocation when the foreign rulers left our shores. This infrastructure determined that political freedom is accompanied by other capabilities which made our country truly independent. This unfortunately is not the case with many countries which followed us on the Independence Road. Many are still not really free, toyed between dependence of one form or another, while we have been our own masters in the true sense of the term. Our non-alignment, our independence in matters related to defence, and our scientific independence to harness the power of the atom or outer space for the common weal, would not have been possible without the availability of the educated manpower.</p>
		<p>Perhaps they could have accomplished more. But the problems were gigantic, and the demands were many When I look at many of the unmet challenges, I remember our achievements and become conscious of our limitations including the environment we inherited. Years of colonial﻿ subjucation have drained from us the strength to create new structures for addressing the problems of our society. Part of the difficulty arises from the historical truth of our missing the Industrial Revolution. When the Western society was revolutionising its social structure by harnessing the full power of the technologies unleashed by the Industrial Revolution, we were still living in a pre-industrial age crippled by a debilitating class and caste-structure. The Industrial Revolution in the West broke all barriers by the very capability of its technology which freed the serfs from rural oppression providing them opportunities and living in new industrial towns that grew almost overnight; in colonial India, we missed it all. We had universities and colleges producing graduates, but not many industries to employ them. The rural poverty and the stratified social structure therefore continued unabated. Thus when our graduates came out of the universities, they had to make do with an environment which did not need their knowledge. If anything, by its strangeness the very university education introduced distortions of its own: the so-called white collar workers who considered any physical work beneath their dignity filling our institutions with people who would merely continue the tradition of command and control at various levels without contributing meaningfully to any activity. Thus university education has become synonymous with a white collar job and a passport to being a respected member of the society. This is not to decry the contributions of the countless many who helped to transform the society and brought in a breath of fresh air in every field. One has only to look at all our freedom fighters to see that how many of them were graduates of universities; in fact, many of them were lawyers from the Mahatma to Rajaji. There were engineering geniuses like Dr. Visveswarayya, or scientists﻿ like C.V. Raman or mathematicians like Srinivasa Ramanujan. They all helped to shape the India of today. Therefore, to decry our higher education as elitist is to ignore these contributions. Without these we would not be where we are today.</p>
		<p>What is wrong with our education, then? The only immediate answer I can submit is that we associate a university degree as a passport to a job. Instead of considering education as a must for human development, we consider it as a mere career requirement. Unfortunately, most of the graduates in India are from liberal arts and they, for want of any specialisation, end up as mere cogs in the wheel of the country's bureaucratic machinery and stratified structure, merely lengthening the decision-making chain. W it takes only one person to mind a bus in the West, we need at least two and sometimes even more! We must therefore make education more meaningful and relevant.</p>
		<p>There have been many attempts in the past to modify the structure including the setting up of new educational institutions. The setting up of Shantiniketan or even the Women's University in Bombay are such examples. We have to build more such institutions, specially now. For a start we must actively discourage a large number of graduates entering into post-graduate education unless they are keen to take up a professional career based on such studies. A large production of M.As or M.Scs without high standards of scholarship and concommitant availability of employment opportunities make a mockery of our very education process. This problem has become more acute with the mushrooming of more universities and the availability of correspondence courses even for the post-graduate education.﻿</p>
		<p>How do we make the university education more relevant and also suited to the nation's requirements? First, of course, is the basic need for a liberal education for every university student. Today our courses have become very narrow, with a narrower specialisation. The arts student is totally ignorant of science and mathematics and even about the recent happenings in science and technology. Often, he or she gapes with ignorance, and wonders when some science spectaculars are announced very similar in feelings to that of a common man who hasn't had the benefit of education at all. There are similar parallels with graduates in science and engineering having no rudimentary knowledge of economics or even of social sciences. These must be corrected, for it is too early for a student to decide which is going to be his or her chosen field. Opportunities must therefore be provided for broad-based courses. This may even reduce the hurried rush we have for engineering and medical colleges. We must also provide opportunities for training in areas relevant to our needs and appropriate to our society. Our undergraduates, for instance, do not have opportunities for vocational training. Many have not experienced the thrill of making things work. It may be repairing of pump-sets in our fields or of radios in villages, or even of cleaning the environment for making water potable. Today, we still depend on uneducated or untrained 'professionals' for any work involving manual labour. I fear this may well be the continuation of our caste system where manual labour was relegated to the lower castes. We must change this, and change it fast, if we have to transform our society into an industrial and enlightened one.</p>
		<p>I have earlier mentioned about the commitment to provide education at least upto the primary level for every child in the country. This mission itself is so gigantic that we do not have adequate resources even to provide for this modest requirement. There are not enough teachers or schools or even books and other student aids. The only option therefore is to adopt unconventional approaches using some of the advanced technologies that are available in other areas. The Electronics Revolution, more appropriately the Microchip Revolution, has radically altered the entire field of Information Processing. We have television and more easily available radios for a wide-spread and effective communication across the entire country. If we look for interactive communication where both parties can talk and discuss, we can then look into the various channels of telecommunication. Communication is no more the mere laying of cables and connecting of telephones. It can be small satellite terminals that link up the entire nation, or may even be battery-operated two-way radio sets or computers which can be charged by sunlight. These facilities can really take schools to every village if we are only ready to modify the available technologies to meet our national and regional requirements. I fear that we have an in-built resistance that makes us use the recent inventionas only in high technology areas. This may be due to the original push for the invention which may, in the first place, have come from the Defence or Space technological requirements. But Japan's successes in recent years have come from this flexibility of using technologies in appropriate places without worrying about their original or intended applications. Even some toys and games produced in that country have electronic microprocessors! The wide electromagentic spectrum invites the society with its rich possibilities.</p>
		<p>I am also detecting a resistance in our country to go in for such technologies for solving our old but still crippling﻿ social problems. The conventional route is well-known and can therefore be adopted without much effort. More important is the manpower we section to these areas. It is not well-equipped to look into these options as we lose our bright youngsters to foreign shores and other remunerative professions which seem to carry social recognition and benefits. In common with the rest of the developing world, we have some lopsided distribution among the specialisation the students choose. Innovative and far-reaching options are therefore not discussed, and we continue the same old rut as though the fate has willed us that way. This gets expressed in variety of self-justifying statements. We abandon computer as a teaching medium because it is considered costly or inferior to a blackboard, forgetting its potential to teach a large group of children and at the same time meeting individual requirements. We must resist this temptation, and instead must seek ways and means of making these modern equipment cheap, easily available and more adaptable to Indian conditions. This may well be our only option to fulfill many of our long standing commitments to the very society we live in. It is said that those who forget the past are condemned to relive it. We must therefore remember our history of not going in for paper or for printing, choosing instead to live with dried and fragile palm leaves. We thus missed the age of enlightenment which engulfed Europe few centuries back. The computer of today may well be the paper and printing of yesterday.</p>
		<p>I have been talking so much defending the university education that I almost seem to have forgotten its products who are graduating today! I most warmly offer my congratulations to them and wish them well for the coming years when they will be exposed to the real world. It may﻿ be a little too early to worry about the world outside just when you have completed your examinations well and passed them successfully. Even preparing for the examination itself trains our mind fully. First, of course, is the need to understand the issues well and assimilate the essentials so that they can be stated when asked for. Hard work is needed as also an intellectual and physical discipline that allows one to sit and study. I believe preparing for an examination is not dissimilar to an army general preparing for war with all strategies considered and some options worked out in detail. There is also the moral issue involved in this preparation. Many of us believe that it is immoral to use wrong methods for passing the examinations and we look down on those with contempt who practise those methods. By trying to bypass, they short-circuit the entire system throwing away the confidence people have on these structures.</p>
		<p>Real life is not unlike college and examination. We must work hard, practise discipline in every aspect of life and ensure that wrong doings are discouraged and not allowed to continue. Every one of us has a responsibility to keep our environment clean, earn our living by honest means and eschew violence in every walk of life. In a sense, this message is not new. All our Puranas talk about this as also the more recent teachings of the Father of the Nation. A disciplined nation can only be built by self-disciplined people. What better place to start this exercise than from the very cradle of learning -- schools and colleges.</p>
		<p>There is also another concem about our young men and women that I want to share with you. This is our attitude to things other than work. Most of us give up physical exercise and games so soon early in our life. We tend to﻿ avoid all forms of physical activity preferring instead to practise only those not involving any physical effort, or exertion. We may have the highest mountain in the world, but only foreigners walk on them. Our beaches are many and sunny and we do not swim there. The Indian flora and fauna are exquisite and rich, and only now we are waking up to their beauty and charm. These are deficiencies which get reflected in our life. We do poorly in sports and in athletic events. We may complain of lack of infrastructure and facilities, but they do not get built up in isolation. An awareness to the beauty of the world we live in and happiness in achieving success through physical labour should be important to every one. I also note with concem the increase in diseases amongst us due to the sedantary life we all seem to practise. While we have wiped out the dreaded diseases of the past by better hygiene and potent medicines, we are replacing it with diseases of sloth. Our ancestors knew of the problems and of Yoga that makes us realise the full physical and spiritual potential in all of us. I would like to ask the graduates of today to analyse these issues as well. For, the university in which you have been privileged to study has as its very motto - NAHI GYNANENA SADRESAM. The spirit of human being is unquenchable and is at its best when there are challenges and opportunities to meet them.</p>
		<p>May I, once again, thank the University for the kind invitation and congratulate all the new graduates of today. For, the future belongs to them.</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">Hon'ble Chancellor, Madame Vice-Chancellor, Hon'ble members of the<br />Syndicate, Senate and cademic council, Distinguished guests,<br />Graduates of the year, Ladies and Gentlemen,</h1>
		<p>I feel greatly honoured for being invited to be your. Chief Guest and deliver the Convocation address this year, the Platinum Jubilee year of the University of Mysore, whose motto, is implicit in its name Manasa Gangotri, that of a great seat of learning from where knowledge should flow across the entire country. I extend my hearty congratulations to all the successful graduates, who by their dint of hardwork and dedication have been able to overcome life's first hurdle. To those, who have not succeeded in this goal, I, offer my best wishes and hope that they will turn this temporary set back into a fresh challenge to face their future life with purpose and determination.</p>
		<p>The University of Mysore, since its establishment in 1916 has been guided by a galaxy of eminent men and distinguished scholars, who as Vice-Chancellors shaped this unique temple "of light, of liberty and of learning', firmly convinced in the words of Rashtra Kavi Kuvempu :<br /> ವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾಲಯಗಳು ಅಣೆಕಟ್ಟುಗಳಂತಲ್ಲ : ಕಾಗದದ, ಉಕ್ಕಿನ ಅಥವಾ ಹೆಂಚಿನ ಕಾರ್ಖಾನೆಗಳಂತಲ್ಲ; ಅವುಗಳಿಂದ ಹೊರಬೀಳುವ ವಸ್ತುಗಳು ಸಜೀವವಾದುವು, ಸಚೇತನವಾದವು : ಒಂದೊಂದೂ ತನ್ನ ವಿಶಿಷ್ಟತೆಯಿಂದ ನಿರುಪಮವಾದುದು ;﻿</p>
		<p>My young friends, you are entering a new phase of life, full of challenges and excitement in an era which is aptly termed as space age, characterised by stupendous scientific advancements and extraordinary technological achievements. You are the privileged torch bearers on whose shoulders, lies the responsibility of leading this nation, to the next century in less than a decade. Even the most spectacular scientific discoveries and technological developments of this century will look like a far off melting away mist compared to those which you will experience in your life time. I sincerely hope your education has adequately prepared you to meaningfully participate in the excitement and challenge of the future overcoming the plethora of problems you have inherited, with courage and determination.</p>
		<p><em>The World you are Inheriting</em></p>
		<p>You have inherited a world full of inequities and disparities - a part of the developing world sustaining 80% of underprivileged global population, with less than 20% of world's resources, constantly plagued with problems of malnutrition, hunger, illiteracy, inadequate health care and an abysymally low standard of living. The very regions and countries which were once the seat of great civilizations, have now become overpopulated, highly polluted and﻿ industrially backward, unable to provide even minimal sustenance to their peoples.</p>
		<p>In our own country, the tragic picture of prevalence of chaos and scarcity, of unrest and terrorism, of large scale unemployment and wastage of valuable manpower, must be rightly raising severe anxieties in your minds as to your future. In spite of spectacular progress. made in some selected areas of science and technology such as space, atomic energy and agriculture, the overall impact of science and technology on the common man has been marginal. The phenomenal growth in the number of universities and institutions of higher learning with over 180 universities, 7000 colleges and six million students, has not made a significant impact in reducing the rate of illiteracy in the country. While the green revolution has enabled the country to increase its food production from 55 to 172 million tons in the last four decades, the available per capita food has remained practically unchanged, leaving a large body of nation's population barely at survival level, just adequate to hold their body and soul together.</p>
		<p>Large scale deforestation resulting in severe erosion and degradation of soil, increase of wasteland and sedimentation of river beds and lakes have become a cause of recurrent floods and drought with untold misery to human lives and livestock. The available land resources in the country has﻿ shrunk to a mere 0.17 ha/capita, which can barely support the present food requirements of the country, let alone meeting the targeted annual requirement of 230 m ton by the year 2000. In spite of the country being blessed with a large amount of rain, indiscriminate wastage of water resources and grossly inadequate conservation practices have led to water shortage, denying even drinking water to thousands of villages. In summary a substantially large part of our countrymen still live well below the poverty line, unemployment of even educated is on the increase, the industrial growth has been unable to initiate a revolution and the educational system has remained stagnant, unable to produce innovators, scientists and technologists who can strike new pathways.</p>
		<p><em>How did this happen?</em></p>
		<p>How did our country, with a long and glorious tradition of science beginning with the ancient times of great teachers like Aryabhata, Varahamihira and Bhaskara, a country which rightly claims credit for discovering "zero", a country which boasts of having the third largest stock of scientific manpower in the world, degenerate into the "present state of affairs? The answer partly lies in the rigid application of religious dogmas and social attitudes which have crippled the very spirit of scientific enquiry,﻿ and chained our society to the relics of the past, unable to adjust itself to the challenges of the technological future. As Sir M. Visvesvaraya put it "The religious and fatalistic philosophy has been used to foster our genius for standing still." We have been consistently preached that there is richness in poverty" and contentment is the true path for attaining nirvana, forgetting that it is only the unemployed who knows that such richness and contentment cannot fill his empty stomach. Even the fact that the basic ethical, social and religious norms cannot be blindly applied but need to be constantly adjusted to make it relevant to any evolving society has been totally forgotten.</p>
		<p>If centuries of colonial exploitation and religion have played havoc, the socio-political atmosphere in the last few decades have virtually crippled the country, using every means - language, caste, creed, colour, religion, - to divide the country, seeding distrust and unrest between man and man and neighbour and neighbour. Rampant corruption, nepotism, unrest, selfishness, violence bred by the socio-political system have brought the nation to a grinding halt. None of us even doubted for a moment the integrity, honesty, sincerity and patriotism of our great freedom fighters like Pandit Nehru, who brought independence to this country, The present socio-political situation has﻿ degenerated to a point, where we are unable to accept the presence of honesty, even if it exists at some places. The paramount need of the country today, is to produce a new generation of statesmen, who will bring back to our vocabulary the words - duty, pride, honesty, sincerity, dedication and honour without such a suggestion being greeted with sarcasm or scorn. The need of the hour is "to take care of the stomach of the living than the glory of the departed in the form of monuments.”</p>
		<p><em>What needs to be done ?</em></p>
		<p>Notwithstanding the seemingly insurmountable problems the nation is faced with, I do not subscribe to the doomsday syndrome. The affairs of the nation can certainly be put into a new order provided we, as a nation, demonstrate the political will and work towards the progress of the nation with complete sincerity and dedication to enable our nation to occupy its rightful place of pride in the community of nations. The existing state of scarcity and social structure of inequity can certainly be abolished by the judicious use of appropriate science and technology, based on sound scientific and economic evaluation. On close examination, we would often find that the adoption of the most sophisticated technology may enable us to take a quantum jump to achieve rapid﻿ transformation of a dormant society. For such rapid transformation to occur the society as a whole must imbibe true scientific spirit and steadfastly work towards its assimilation into its culture fabric. We have to reaffirm our faith in what Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the great architect of modern India firmly believed that "science alone can solve the • problems of hunger and poverty, insanitation and illiteracy, of superstition and deadening customs and tradition, of vast resources running to waste, of a rich country inhabited by starving people".</p>
		<p>The remarkable achievements in science and technology, in particular, the release of energy from the atom, remarkable growth in electronics and materials, the emerging biotechnology revolution and the spectacular developments in space, offer a new beacon of hope to all developing societies. New technologies are becoming available for tapping abundant sources of energy such as solar, nuclear, wind, tidal and geothermal resources in nature. The rapia developments in genetic engineering and biotechnology hold the best promise to initiate yet another green revolution. The vast and unlimited benefits from space technology which already extend over communication, meteorology, TV transmission, education, agriculture, industrial growth, resource management, environmental protection, disaster mitigation, flood and﻿ drought management, health and entertainment, virtually touching every facet of human endeavour, needs to be increasingly exploited. Space by virtue of its ability to provide instantaneous access to even remotest corners of the nation, has already shrunk time and distance by initiating a communication revolution in the country. Space imageries have 'enabled us to dilineate underground acquifier potential, monitor soil health and identify the extent and type of wasteland at village level, half of which amounting to almost 25 m. ha can be reclaimed for productive agricultural use. Continuous weather watch, flood and cyclone monitoring and disaster warning systems are now regularly used to save thousands of lives, just as repetitive monitoring of vegetation health from space provides the necessary advance warning of drought to take appropriate remedial measures.</p>
		<p>The crisis of continuous global warming and resulting irreversible climatic changes predicted for the coming decades, which is threatening the very survival of human and biotic species on this planet, can and will have to be averted by the worldwide implementation of appropriate environment friendly. strategies. Wide acceptance of the revised Montreal Protocol, which aims at controlling the increasing anthropogenic activities pumping various harmful gases into the atmosphere﻿ and affecting the entire green house equilibrium,' is undoubtedly a step in the positive direction. The new tools being provided by Science and Technology can lead to ecologically sustainable integrated development at micro level to ensure that this world will continue to be habitable for future generations.</p>
		<p>I am convinced that scientists will discover alternate energy sources, find ecologically sound agricultural technologies and develop new varieties of seeds and genetic strains to enable hüman kind to survive even with limited land and water resources. Establishment of space platforms and even space habitats eventually leading to manufacture in space and exploitation of other planetary resources are already within our sight. Worldwide communication revolution, already initiated will bring the world closer with the help of large computer networks and artificial intelligence. I believe, within your own life time, you will be able to solve the great mystery of the origin of the universe, the unifying principle governing its evolution over the past billions of years and man's own position in the universe.<em>The Role of Universities in the Changing Scenario</em></p>
		<p>A fast changing technological scenario demands continual upgradation and change﻿ of our educational system, to make it more purposeful and relevant to suit the changing requirements of a society and to ensure its organic, self-reliant and holistic growth. Unless our universities are able to inculcate the interdisciplinary character in both basic and applied sciences, the universities will only produce a large breed of followers but not a generation of excellent innovators, who can participate fully in the "march of science, which is probably. mankind's greatest enterprise". Continuous adoptation of new system of disciplines is very essential to enable the graduates coming out of the universities to understand and appreciate the cybernatic relationship embodied in scientific and social systems.</p>
		<p>The present university education and its examination system which has been reduced to imparting a collection of catalogued information needs a drastic reform aimed at provoking a logical thought process and the development of creative and innovative genius of the human mind. Innovative changes are produced only through new ideas and not by money and it is only such ideas that have the power of transformation. Only when the new generation realises that education is a continuing process which instead of ending, begins at the university level, it will be able to effectively deal with the rapid technological obsolescence and the﻿ nation will produce creators of jobs rather than mere seekers of jobs. We have to realise, to quote Alvin Toffler, "The technology of tomorrow requires not millions of highly lettered men, ready to work in unison at endlessly repeated 'jobs, not men who take orders in unblinking fashion, but men who can make critical judgements, who can weave their way through novel environments, who are quick to spot new relationships in the rapidly changing reality.”</p>
		<p>Prevailing education system even in the industrially advanced countries has been seriously questioned as to its adequacy to meet the demands of the fast growing technology in a competitive world. Our own educational system with its age old rigid tradition, requires a fundamental change in its outlook, if graduates of the present day are to play their rightful role in the society. Even worse, is the ingress of politics into our educational system, which if left unchecked, will surely result in even our best institutions to degenerate and cease to be temples of excellence. Mediocrity in educational institutions can only end up multiplying mediocrity.</p>
		<p>Excellence in institutions of higher learning can only be sustained when they are encouraged to carry out high quality research and development with the top quality scientists and engineers. While the financial allocation for scientific research and develop﻿ment, which at present is around 1% of the GNP of the country, needs to be atleast doubled, forging a closer interaction between academic institutions and industries, to work together in partnership, is essential to make the Indian industries' vibrant, dynamic and forward looking. Very few Indian industries, today support any significant research and development, unlike in developed nations where almost 50% of the funds required for research and development are supported by industries. We need policy controls which facilitate establishment of a new atmosphere of excellence and not licensing controls which have only promoted kit culture and made Indian industries look for quick returns by continuously relying on outside know-how.</p>
		<p>While the essentiality of education for the liberation of human beings is well recognised, unless eradication of illiteracy is tackled on a war footing and not by mere slogan adoption, over 30% of our population will continue to remain illiterate even by the turn of this century. Clearly the answer lies not in simple linear expansion of educational facilities, but by widespread use of innovative, result-oriented technologies. New concepts involving dedicated "GRAMSAT" satellites specifically tailored to provide audio-visual education to the vast rural masses in health, hygiene, family planning, better agricultural practices and environment, are probably the answer for realising the dream of eradication of illiteracy within the next decade. If only our universities show an initiative, they can now play a positive lead role by adopting the new technologies to provide both continuing education to the new generation of graduates and in eradicating illiteracy in rural areas to enable the nation, as a whole to achieve a smooth transition into the next century.</p>
		<p><em>Conclusion :</em></p>
		<p>My young friends, you belong to the generation of the 21st century and it is in your hands to usher a new era of hope and abundance. What you need is new spirit of hope and confidence, as expressed by the great poet Kuvempu<br /> ನಮಗಿಂದಿಗೆ ಬೇಕಾದುದು ಉದ್ದಾರದ, ಆಸಕ್ತಿ, ವಂತಿವಂತನೆ, ಓ ಮಾನವ, ಕಟಿ ಬಂಧನಗೈ, ನಿಲ್ಲು! ಯಂಗದೊಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ಜಗದೊಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ನಿನ್ನೊಳೊನ್ ನೀಂ reo!</p>
		<p>I hope that the insight and light you have gained here will provide you with sufficient perception to tread safely into the unknown. Let the past be only a part of your history but not an example to blindly emulate. Look at the future with wide open mind and accept the technical challenges as they come. I believe there is a mystery cycle in human events. To some generations much is given, of other generations, like my own, much is expected; but it is your generation, with the﻿ responsibility of taking the country to the next century, which has rendezvous with destiny. I am convinced that you can achieve this goal, if you can substitute the inferiority complex developed through centuries with courage, hope, scientific rational and dedication. As Sir C. V. Raman said, "what is needed in India today is the destruction of the defeatist spirit. We need a spirit of victory, a spirit that will carry us on to our right place under the sun. A spirit which will recognise that we as inheritors of proud civilization are entitled for a rightful place on this planet. If that indomitable spirit were to arise, nothing can hold us from achieving our rightful destiny".</p>
		<p>My young friends, I wish all of you a bright future and pray that you may be bestowed with necessary strength, courage and wisdom to face life with all its uncertainties, but full of challenges.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">CONVOCATION ADDRESS BY Dr MANMOHAN SINGH,<br />HỌN'BLE UNION MINISTER FOR FINANCE, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, NEW DELHI.</h1>
		<p><em>Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Pro-Chancellor, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, Distinguished Guests, Learned Faculty', Alumni and Graduands:</em></p>
		<p>I deem it a great privilege to deliver this convocation address to your University, a renowned seat of learning nestling in one of our most beautiful cities. On the occasion of your Platinum Jubilee, I join all of you in paying my homage to the late Sir M. Visves varayya, former Dewan . of Mysore, and to His Highness Nalvadi Krishnaraj Wodeyar who started and nourished this great University. Some of India's most illustrious sons have been associated with this University. I refer in particular to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Sardar K. M. Panikkar and Shri R. K. Narayan. The University has completed 75 years of outstanding service to the nation. I pray that its next 75 years will be even more productive and creative.</p>
		<p>I remember my own convocation day as one of great elation-I then thought that it was the greatest day of my life. I have lived through stirring times, and my memory begins to blur. But the combination of achievement and hope that graduation represents﻿ makes the Convocation Day a landmark in all our lives.</p>
		<p>What awaits you is not all roses. I would be surprised if mest of you did not leave the University with a nostalgia for the past and a certain fear of the future. If it were in my power at this moment to grant you a gift, I would make you a present of self-confidence.</p>
		<p>The world you will enter is a different one from the one I walked into when I graduated. There was one aspect of the world of my youth that I treasure, an aspect I would greatly like to see restored : that somehow the society in which I lived and worked was more united, more naturally, unselfconsciously Indian than the one that is emerging today.</p>
		<p>That all-permeating Indianness is still strong. My principal civil servants, for instance, come from four corners of India. One comes from Tamil Nadu, another from Kerala, one from Punjab and another from Gujarat ; and they have all sérved India in their own ways. The India in which I grew up, earned my livelihood, brought up my children--this India has meant much to me. I have regarded all of it as my home, and I could not have been at home anywhere else.</p>
		<p>But in some important respects, that India is being questioned, challenged. My own home state is rent by strife over its Indianness, a strife that fills me with great sadness. Competitive politics has raised caste and communal tensions to a dangerous level in several parts of our country. There is more parochiality﻿ in the governments. Politics is ceasing to be a vehicle of purposeful social change. Even industry finds its cosmopolitan character under threat of erosion. This is what I find most disturbing, even more for you than for myself. You have the future of this country in your hands; I would urge you to work to restore its Indianness, its instinctive unity.</p>
		<p>There is another important respect which requires urgent national attention. I refer to the visible signs of erosion of national self-confidence and to the need for strong corrective action.</p>
		<p>The sense of confident nationhood was the most palpable characteristics of the era of my youth. Our leaders - Gandhiji. Nehru, Patel-had this confidence in great abundance ;' they had no doubts about the potential of this nation. or about its ability to look after itself. They were, infact alergic dependence and its consequences--to sycophancy on the one hand and truculence on the other. The one thing they tried to impart to the country was selfconfidence and self-respect. Their influence is still strong and their example would continue to inspire us to look the world in the face. But it must be admitted that cf late there has been a weakening of this feeling of self-confidence. A feeling has grown that somehow we Indians are inferior to other nations, that we cannot compete against other countries in the global markets, that therefore we must build strong protective walls to insulate oui economy from outside competition. I regard this feeling of lack of self-confidence﻿ a major barrier to the realization of India's immense development potential.</p>
		<p>The leaders of our national struggle had faith in our nation, and the greatest homage we can pay. them would be if we could restore the nation's belief in itself--not simply restore it, but revivify, rediscover, and redesign it. Let me illustrate what I mean by taking examples from the fields which I know well.</p>
		<p>Take, for instance, the area of trade. Industrialists in this country are blessed with many advantages that other countries do not enjoy. Our wage costs are very low.. Our food prices are generally lower than elsewhere. We grow some of the world's best cotton at extremely competitive costs. Our raw materials, whether it is ironore or coal or bauxite or bamboo, are available at throwaway prices.</p>
		<p>But even with these advantages, the idea of our industry competing with industry abroad encounters resistance. Our important duties are amongst the highest in the world. We are trying to reduce them. We have reduced the peak duties to 110 per cent in the last budget. With this, the duties on some products have fallen to the same level as the duties on their inputs. This appears to some of our industrialists as unreasonable. They argue that their products must bear a duty that is at least 20 per cent higher than the duty on their components and raw materials. But if they made full use of the cheap labour and raw materials available in this country, it is not﻿ they but their competitors abroad that should need protection.</p>
		<p>Excessive protection of industry and import substitution regardless of cost have created a pattern of industrialization which generates few additional jobs. It has sheltered monopolies and accentuated disparities in income and wealth. Protection entails a subsidy given to the producer at the cost of the consumer. Heavy protection granted to industry has constituted massive discrimination against agriculture ; no wonder that the disparities in living standards between rural and urban India have increased over time.</p>
		<p>Industries and firms may be protected to correct inequalities in competition. If firms are new or small they may deserve protection until they can compete on equal terms. But they should not become permanent infants. It is important not to equate protection with patriotism and trade with sin. Glorification of autarky can do our country enormous harm. India has a fairly diversified natural resource endowment but it has to be recognized that on a per capita basis we are not well endowed with natural resources. Thus India has to become a major international trading nation if its development potential is to be realized in full measure.</p>
		<p>With our manpower, with our natural resources, we can capture considerable, share of markets in the world. We can be the world's leading exporters of tropical goods, textiles, steel and engineering goods. With larger exports we can import materials from elsewhere and become competitive manufacturers of goods﻿ for which we do not have cheap inputs - electronic goods, chemicals, wooden and metal handicrafts. Export activity would generate production and employment in our own country. We would not need to send our workers abroad to work under arduous conditions ; they could make a gainful living in India itself. With a more dynamic economy, the graduates of our institutes of science and technology will not need to migrate to foreign lands in such large numbers. I cannot help feeling that our problems of poverty and unemployment would bocome much more tractable if we paid greater attention to the exploitation of the world market.</p>
		<p>Trade also has political implications. Japan and Germany are major world powers today. not because of powerful armies or lethal weapons, but because of their trade with the world. As the world prospers, they will inevitably prosper ; on the other hand, they are so important to the world that the world cannot. let them go down. The world has a stake in a country in proportion to its international trade. Our share in world trade has declined from 3 per cent in 1950 to half a per cent today. The result is that the world's stake in our welfare and prosperity is minimal today.</p>
		<p>Our country has been in serious economic trouble in the last two years. We have looked for help from outside. Irrespective of their political colour. irrespective of their nationalist postures at home. finance ministers have travelled abroad in search of support. Yet they got very little. The reason is not that the world is unduly hardhearted towards﻿ us, but that our importance to the world has diminished. Our place in the world is not measured by the size of our population or our arsenal, but by the goods and services we export and import. India sits astride the busiest trade lanes of the world. All the sea and air traffic between the east and the west pases along its seaways and airways. But little of it originates or ends in India. It is my hope that this trade will not simply pass us by, and that we shall take our rightful share of it.</p>
		<p>But the world outside cannot be forced to take our goods and services; it must be coaxed to do so. We have to produce the goods the world wants, up to the quality standards that it demands, with the techniques it finds acceptable. This is where we need not only to have knowledge of the world. but to use it in ways it recognises. Our country has imported technologies on a considerable scale. We have sent thousands abroad to be trained. But if we want to learn at home how pepole work and produce abroad, it is also possible to do so by letting people from abroad come and show us; and one way to get a live demonstration is to invite them to set up enterprises in India.</p>
		<p>come</p>
		<p>The idea of foreign direct investment generates considerable heat in our country. It is evident that there are large corporations in world, and that they can play a role in the foreign policies of their home countries. One should not be unmindful of the possibility that their interests may conflict with our﻿ national interests. But their power should not be exaggerated; nor should our ability to protect our interests be belittled. The East India Company had acquired control of a large part of east-west trade by means of a control of trade routes, ports, centres of production and markets. No multinational corporation of today comes close to acquiring that kind of control. Further, the Government today has more means and more knowledge to regulate the activities of foreign enterprises in the national interest. This is what independence means; this is what independence should be used for- not for cutting ourselves off from the global production system, but to interact with it for our own benefit.</p>
		<p>And worldwide, direct investment is not a monopoly of large transnational corporations ; more often, it is small, knowledge-intensive firms that make the most difference. For instance, small Japanese firms driven out of production by rising wages have gone to Malaysia and made it the world's biggest exporter of rubber gloves. Italian shoemakers looking for new opportunities have provided the backbone of the highly successful Brazilian shoe exports. Mysore and its surroundings today produce some of the finest silks. The most expensive garment in the world is the Japanese silk kimono. Why should not Japanese pattern-makers come and make kimonos out of Mysore silk?</p>
		<p>For trade, technology and investment are not the only things the world can give us ; there is a world full of knowledge outside. There are books, journals﻿ that inform and educate ; and with the advent of electronic communications, new means of knowledge are arising. The creation of knowledge is a global process involving universities, research institutes, industries and inventors.</p>
		<p>We too can participate in this process with enormous benefit. For much of this knowledge is available at costs for lower than we would incur to produce it, and the value that can be produced by using that knowledge is vast multiple of the cost of the knowledge. It is shortsighted to try import substitution in knowledge at whatever cost. It can do considerable harm to our technologieal dynamism. It can cut India off from the community of nations where knowledge grows in an ordered framework. The successful absorption, assimilation and adaptation of available knowledge is a critical aspect of development. It is a necessary precursor to the stage where we can ourselves generate new knowledge. India needs a strong research and development base to emerge as a front-ranking nation in the world. We must 'spend more on research and development. Our scientists and technologists ought to be provided with facilities comparable to those available abroad. But R &#38; D must have a proper focus. We ought to pay particular attention to areas which have hitherto been neglected, where we cannot depend on foreigners to generate new knowledge and where new knowledge can make a major contribution to the enhancement of India's development pctential and the improvement of living conditions of our masses. I refer in particular to the need for stronger R &#38; D﻿ efforts in the areas of agriculture, post-harvest technologies, rural development, primary health care, renewable sources of energy and control of environmental degradation.</p>
		<p>So how are we to regain our self-confidence, to restore our self-reliance ? Self-reliance should not mean self-defeating withdrawal and futile confrontation, it should mean thinking for oneself. An essential element in restoring the spirit of self-reliance must be to change the policy environment which gave sanctified withdrawal and glorified confrontation, and to open our country again to the winds of change. Self-confidence comes from practice, from successful adaptation to change ; for adaptation, change has to be invited into our country.</p>
		<p>This is what we have been engaged in doing in our recent policy initiatives. The intention behind the initiatives is not to betray our nation, nor to weaken its resolve for creative self-réliance. It is to broaden the arena for our productive forces, to bring the best out of them by raising the level of challenge, to make our resources more productive and to distribute the fruits of that productivity more equitably. Whatever the intentions of our policymakers, their ability to help the poor and the weak is fettered today by the generally low levels of incomes, the limited reach of the state and the absorption of its resources in less deserving uses. Stimulating the growth of production, removing the bias in favour of capital-intensity, giving a fairer deal to agriculture, making producers compete for rewards﻿ these things are not foreign devilry but meaning of self-reliance.</p>
		<p>But practice is helped by example, and action by resolve. For this leadership our nation will look to you, to young men and women whom it has educated at much cost. I would invite you-I would challenge you-to look at the world with frank and confident eyes, and to translate the lessons it holds into a better life for our people. In this great endeavour you will have my enduring good wishes. May your path be blessed.﻿</p>

		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">CONVOCATION ADDRESS BY PROF. ERIC<br /> R. GILBERTSON, PRESIDENT, SAGINAW VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY<br />CENTER, MICHIGAN, U. S. A.</h1>
		<p><em> Your Excellency the Governor, Honorable Pro-Chancellor, Honorable Vice-Chancellor, Distinguished Members of the Syndicate and the Senate, Respected Members of the Faculty and honored graduates, ladies and gentlemen, my friends:</em></p>
		<p>I am deeply grateful for the honor of addressing you on this very important day in the life of your University and in the lives of its graduates.</p>
		<p>I bring you greetings from the academic community of my University, my State of Michigan and my nation. I know that your invitation to me is also a gesture of respect and friendship to my University, and this too is deeply appreciated and sincerely reciprocated.</p>
		<p>There must be something deep in the human instinct that moves pepple, in virtually all the varieties of human cultures, to create ceremonies to mark the important moments and changes in our lives-births, religious commitments, weddings, funerals,﻿ celebrations of achievement. The American humorist, H. L. Mencken, called this "the immemorial tendency of mankind to concoct rituals.” And so it is with convocations like this one and like all those graduation ceremonies which occur in our sister educational institutions throughout all the continents of the world.</p>
		<p>But we know-especially those of us closely associated with institutions so deeply grounded in tradition, like universities that our traditions, rituals and ceremonies truly are important. They give us a sense of identity and continuity across the years and the generations; they serve to remind us of the importance of events and accomplishments; they reaffirm and give dignity to important values in our cultures, values at the core of the university's reason for being-such as the imperative of courage and integrity in the search for truth, the duty of each generation to transmit the best of its knowledge and wisdom and culture to the next, the dignity of personal and intellectual achievement.</p>
		<p>And so, for now and for these few moments, it is altogether right and proper that we pause to note the passing of time and the important changes taking place in your lives and in the life of this distinguished University by coming together﻿ in this ceremony-officials, teachers, students, friends and relatives we hold most dear-to honor our acadèmic traditions, to celebrate your academic achievement, to share our hope for the future...and for however brief a time, to reflect upon what meaning we might ascribe to these things.</p>
		<p>In my country at such ceremonies it is customary for a representative of one generation to address the graduates from the next, purporting to offer perspective or wisdom hard earned through the trials and errors of his or her generation's experience. Hope endures, even in the face of all historical evidence to the contrary, that the speaker on such an auspicious occasion will say something that leaves' a lasting impression, something that reveals some profound truth or instills some lofty thought.</p>
		<p>But, alas, with due humility, I also know that those of you about to graduate are likely to be preoccupied at this inoment with other thoughts of family and friends, of plans and perhaps even of your own celebrations. But I know that you leave your studies here with a sense of gratitude for opportunity that has been yours. You have been well taught and you learned well, and on behalf of the generations before you I offer sincere congratulations. And together we pray for your happiness and the fulfillment of your promise as individuals and as a generation.</p>		
		<p class="text-center">THE UNIVERSITY ... OUR CHOSEN<br /> INSTRUMENT OF HOPE </p>
		<p>At some American universities, new graduates are solemnly welcomed "to the company of educated men and women.” That strikes me as a bit pretentious and conceited, for we find educated people in all stations of life, from a wide variety of backgrounds and with a wide variety of intelligences. Academic institutions surely have no monopoly on the production of truly educated people.</p>
		<p>We also know, poignantly, that mere graduation from a university - however distinguished-does not ensure that a person is truly educated. And, in some ways, to be truly educated means only that we are more fully aware of our own ignorance.</p>
		<p>The Father of this great nation, Mahatma Gandhi, had only a limited faith in universities--once even declaring that he was "an enemy of higher education as it is given in this country," primarily because of what he saw then as universities too eager to mimic foreign cultures while neglecting things genuinely Indian,</p>
		<p>All our universities have critics today who find fault in what we teach and how we teach it, and in our occasional arrogance. Universities need critics, and those of us who﻿ know universities best are usually among those critics-though we are loving critics, for we also know best our universities' great strengths, their great potential for good. Universities are, flaws and all, still the chosen instruments of my society and yours for the fullest development of precious human talent. Universities are, flaws and all, still the chosen instruments of my society and yours for the improvement of life and the discovery of truth.</p>
		<p>Such is the secular faith of my society and of yours-a faith in the value of education.</p>
		<p>Thomas Jefferson—the author of my country's Declaration of Independence and its third president-first and best expressed these thoughts for Americans: That open opportunity for individuals to better themselves through education was indispensable not just for economic prosperity but also for the survival of democracy. Only through such open opportunity could a nation ensure that the natural aristocracy of the talented” might emerge to defeat the "artificial" aristocracy of privilege and wealth. This is an idea and an ideal that was and is vital to social and political democracy.</p>
		<p>And India's educational policy of 1913 and the platinum jubilee anniversary of your distinguished University both stand as moving﻿ testimony to your State's and your Nation's commitment to this same principle--the importance of opportunity for your people.</p>
		<p>Those of us who serve these universities, these chosen instruments, also have a special responsibility. We know that institutions like ours are fragile-even as truth is fragile. They exist by public sufferance and with public support even as they are determinedly free to criticize the conventional wisdom, the status quo and the powerful interests. Yet they remain the most precious assets of our societies-worthy of our care, our fierce defense, our deep affection.</p>
		<p>We who have enjoyed the benefits of the university are still among a privileged few. Therefore, this moment, this ceremony, should inspire us to pause and consider what this means to be educated-what special gifts and what special responsibilities does this privilege confer or impose ?</p>
		<p class="text-center">TO BE EDUCATED ... UNDERSTANDING<br /> CHANGE AND WHAT IS CHANGELESS</p>
		<p>Education at its best prepares people for change. And in this, our time, changetechnological change, demographic change, political and diplomatic and economic change-is relentless and pervasive and ever accelerating. We ignore the tides of change only at our great peril.﻿</p>
		<p>Still, there is much about life in our World that is relatively unchanging-we may call this the "human condition." Whatever the chosen professions of you graduates-medicine, law, the sciences, education, whatever--you will likely spend far more of your time and energy and agony puzzling over the vexing mysteries of your fellow humans than you will over matters in your technical expertise. You will wonder what makes them do the things they do, why they cannot or will not change or why they change too quickly, how reason or emotion collide in personal and political or organizational busincss. And even as individuals struggle to understand and deal with one another, whole nations and huge social organisms likewise worry and scheme in life's larger and more dangerous arenas.</p>
		<p>Beyond mankind's fascination with the natural and physical universe, man's principal fascination is still with man himself. And so it has been since the authors of our classicswhether Kalidasa's "Shakuntala" or Homer's e The Illiad "--and the authors of our sacred texts—whether the Vedas or the Koran or the Bible all tried to explain the common aspects of our common humanity. And it is that common and relatively unchanging humanity that makes these classics and sacred texts still so relevant to our understanding of ourselves and one another today.﻿</p>
		<p>The themes of our art and literature are the themes of everyman's life : love, hope, wonder, disappointment, the passing of time, our universally human conflicts between passion and reason, between' ethics and ambition, between the illusion of immortality and the fear of death. These things are at the essence of what it means to be human; these are the things we share best through our arts and literature. And sharing these things brings us together across the barriers of language and geography and generations. Sharing these things reminds us we are not alone in this life.</p>
		<p>Education, at its best, has taught us to understand and prepare for change, but also to understand things that are timeless and enduring.</p>
		<p class="text-center">TO BE EDUCATED ... DISCERNING<br /> DIFFERENCES BUT UNDERSTANDING<br />ALL WE SHARE </p>
		<p>Education, at its best, does teach us to make critical distinctions between things and ideas-distinctions that may be camouflaged at a superficial level. There are critical differences between facts and ideas and systems of government and culture and faith. To be educated surely means to have the sophisticated capacity to discern and understand sometimes subtle but nonetheless critical differences.﻿</p>
		<p>But at least equally important, education should also teach us to see and understand our similarities, our sameness as humans on this small planet. We share so much ... and we are not alone.</p>
		<p>I remember first developing a keen interest in and affection for India as a small boy. One of my favorite television programs was about an Indian boy-I only wish I could now remember his name. But I do clearly remember that he was portrayed as having a pet elephant and living in a land of fierce lions and majestic Bengal tigers. His world seemed so different from mine, so dangerous and so exotic-yet somehow I could share his dreams, his sense of danger, his hurt feelings, his love for family and friends. I felt that I knew him well ... he was my. friend.</p>
		<p>Later, having had the opportunity to know and make personal friends from India, I learned that they had likewise been entertained with images of American youths—and they imagined that we all lived as cowboys in the "Wild West," that our lives were like those fictional characters portrayed by John Wayne and later Clint Eastwood.</p>
		<p>How little we really knew of one another's lives and cultures—but still how well we seemed to understand the very﻿ human experiences and feelings that we shared in common.</p>
		<p>Here today I am struck not by the differences between our nations and our peoples--as large and real as these truly are-but rather by the similarities.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Political values</em></p>
		<p> We share many of the same political values. The Indian Constitution and the Constitution of the United States contain so many similar or even identical words and phrases expressing so many common values—"We the People” both cherish freedom of speech and expression, freedom to assemble peaceably, the rights to life and liberty and the procedures established by law, the freedom to profess and practice religious beliefs, equality before the law. Your Constitution's commitment to "justice” and the "dignity of the individual” are also reflected in our nation's precious "Declaration of Independence.”</p>
		<p>The fabric of our political values are almost as if cut from the same bolt of cloth.</p>
		<p><em>Search for place in New World Order</em></p>
		<p>Each of our nations is at this point in history searching for a new diplomatic and military role in what some are calling es the New World Order”-though the term﻿ chaos" may be a more accurate descriptor than "order." It is a World no longer dominated by a cruel American-Soviet competition for influence and hegemony, a World in which other nations were unfairly forced to choose between friendship with one or the other. But today it is also a World more' unstable and in many ways even more dangerous.</p>
		<p>It is a World less threatened by the fear of massive nuclear holocaust, but a World in which man's inhumanity to man is no less painful or lethal-witness the recent tragedies in Kuwait, in Somalia, in Bosnia.</p>
		<p>And each of our nations is struggling, under new leadership, with economic dilemmas. Yours is how to harness a superb technological capability with an ample labor force to improve the lives of your people. Ours is how to discipline and reinvigorate what was once the World's most productive economy in order to succeed in peaceful competition with new economic powers in a united Europe and a Japan-dominated Pacific Rim.</p>
		<p>And both our nations are struggling, under new leadership, to determine whether these democracies--ours the oldest and yours the largest in the World-can be disciplined to constrain military spending, to reduce public debt and to repair the maldistribution of its wealth.</p>
		<p class="text-center"><em>Faith and a secular state</em></p>
		<p>We share a belief in the importance of a secular state, but still we are both a religious people. And we share a faiththough called by different names and expressed in different rituals, our shared faith is that human lives do have meaning, that the divine virtues of love and humility and forgiveness can redeem our human flaws, that shorn of our petty differences and disagreements we are indeed all brothers and sisters. The teachings of the Vedas and the Ramayana, the teachings of Moses and Jesus, of the prophet Mohammed and the Buddha, all affirm these great lessons and these great hopes.</p>
		<p>There are those in both of our societies who_in the name of religious faith, whether Christianity or Islam or Hinduism-would use the power of the State to impose their beliefs or to limit the rights of those who do not agree with their specific dogmas. And there are other societies and nations where such an unholy alliance of religion and government have done violence to that most basic of human rights the freedom of conscience. They show us the dangers of such an alliance.﻿</p>
		<p>But as our Constitutions make clear, the founding fathers of both our countries well understood these dangers. Both had seen, painfully, how religion could be appropriated to misuse the powers of government. Both were also men and women of faith themselves—but people who also understood that true religious faith must be freely accepted and expressed, that true religious faith should not, could not, be imposed by force of government.</p>
		<p class="text-center">Forsaken ideals and their price</p>
		<p>Finally, and even while relations between India ,and the United States have in recent history been sometimes close and sometimes strained, we share many common aspects of our histories. Our nations each emerged through a heroic struggle from the oppressions of colonialism-whether the tyrannies of King George or the tyrannies of the East India Company and the British raj. India was born in non-violent revolution, even as America was born in rebelion, and both nations made great sacrifices for their freedom</p>
		<p>Each of our, nations is founded upon noble ideals, but each has also failed these ideals-as with the shame of racism in the United States and the shame of religious intolerance in India.﻿</p>
		<p>And both our nations still pay dearly for those sins-we pay with lives and with hatred.</p>
		<p>Perhaps we have yet to learn what the authors of the American Declaration of Independence said--that "All men are created equal." And perhaps we have yet to learn the lesson from Mahatma Gandhi, who once said that the Harijans too are the children of God.</p>
		<p class="text-center">TO BE EDUCATED ... TO AFFIRM HOPE</p>
		<p>But to be educated means also to recognize that while we as societies and as individuals--are the products of our history, we need not necessarily remain the prisoners of that history. The idea and the ideals of education, and institutions like ours, stand for the fundamental proposition that people can learn, people can understand, people can be changed, freed from their worst traits and instincts: And in so doing people can become not just more competent but more compassionate, not just more prosperous but more kind, not just more powerful but more humane.</p>
		<p>To be educated to believe in and to care about education-means to affirm such hope.</p>
		<p>This was the hope of Abraham Lincoln who, nearing the end of my nation's tragic Civil War and nearing the end of his life,﻿ implored us with these great words : "With malice toward none, with charity toward all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see that right, let us ... do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”</p>
		<p>It may be easy for cynics, who witness history's repeated tragedies, to dismiss such hopes, as impractical or 'naive. And it is true--mankind has, throughout his history, practiced greed, revenge, hatred. But education must still give us hope-hope that we need not be prisoners of our passions, prisoners of our history.</p>
		<p>Lincoln's hopes survived the horrors of slavery, the horrors of bloody battles at places like Antietam and Gettysburg.</p>
		<p>This was, of course, also the hope of Mahatma Gandhi-that, to use Biblical phrases as he sometimes did, the lion would someday lie down with the lamb, that swords would be beaten into plowshares, that the meek would inherit the Earth. This was a hope that did not die at Chauri Chaura; it could not be killed, even by General Dyer at Amritsar.</p>
		<p>And this was the hope of Gandhi's disciple, Martin Luther King, Jr., who thirty years ago spoke eloquently of his dream of a just and a decent society based on principles of fairness and the love of brotherhood.﻿</p>
		<p>King's dream endured the indignities of segregated schools and brutal beatings, the squalid jail cells of Selma, Alabama.</p>
		<p>And the hopes of Mahatma Gandhi and Lincoln and King-powerful ideas that move us still today-all were not extinguished when they were taken from us at Ford's Theater or in the garderr at Birla House or at a motel in Memphis, Tennessee. As Nehru said of Gandhi, theirs "was no ordinary light.'</p>
		<p>Their lessons for us are as old as time and as young as the birth of the human spirit in each new child-they speak of the horrors of hate and the power of love ... and of hope.</p>
		<p>I am told that the Hindus have a legend concerning a mythical bird, called Bherunda. As I understand the story, the bird has a single body but two necks, two heads, and two separate consciousnesses. After an eternity together, these two heads come to hate each other. Both swallow pebbles and poison to injure the other but, of course, the whole bird dies a painful death. It is brought back to life through the mercy of Lord Krishna and thus reminds us that hatred harms nou only the object of that hatred, but, perhaps even more, the one who hates.</p>
		<p>And hatred feeds upon itself, it builds. The Czech writer and statesman, Vaclav Havel, once observed that " Collective hatred﻿ shared, spread and deepened by people capable of hatred, has a special magnetic attraction and therefore has the power to attract countless other people..... We must struggle energetically against all forms of collective hatred not only on principal, because evil must always be dealt with, but in our own interests.”</p>
		<p>This is the lesson today for Sarajevo and for Beirut and Mogadishu. And this is the lesson today for the streets of Los Angeles and of Ayodhya.</p>
		<p>We find ourselves together here todayat this point in time and space and circumstance-as recipients of the most precious privilege our societies offer, the privilege of a university education. As educated people we must also join together. in hope-the hope of Mahatma Gandhi and Lincoln and King for peaceful and caring societies, the hope of our generations and yours for a World free from aggression and nuclear terror, the hope of the founders of your University and mine and universities everywhere that the education you received will enable you to live life more fully and well.</p>
		<p>And I join today in the hope of your teachers here, and of their colleague teachers everywhere, that you, the educated, will practice your professions and live your lives﻿ so as to give hope to others-respecting the dignity of their persons and the sanctity of their souls, the bonds that tie us together as brothers and sisters of this human family.</p>
		<p>Thank you.</p>
